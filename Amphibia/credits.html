my html tryhard fic for <a href="https://html-tryhard.tumblr.com/">HTML Fic Event Week</a>! check out the other fics too!
leave the creators style on. this should be reversii / darkmode compatible. 
this fic is basically outsider pov and beyond of canon, so, major spoilers for the entire series (duh) but especially so for s3
i dare you to click / tap on anything and everything you see here, it'll be worth it, i promise.
also,... pls leave a comment, this fic took a lot out of me

<!-- end notes -->

oh my god. this took so stupidly long. and then i just kept making it longer. 
ok i know that canon takes place between 2019 and 2020, but if you see an era inaccurate meme - no you didnt. rememeber kids, covid didnt exist in canon and memes are timeless!
