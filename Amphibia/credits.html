title: "chat, is this real?"

tags: 
Spoiler for the entire series, Mostly Canon Compliant, 
Epistolary, Social Media, Outsider POV, Mixed Media, Non traditional format,
Experimental style, HTML Tryhard, HTML, CSS, In universe memes,
Snapchat, BeReal, Tumblr, Reddit, Chatting & Text Messaging, Twitter, Youtube,
4chan, well functionally its 4chan but mostly a copycat,
Interactive Fiction, Well the interaction is optional tbh,
abusing the functionality of details / summary to enhance the immersion
Crack, Fic is longer than word count indicates

<!-- begin notes -->
my html tryhard fic for <a href="https://html-tryhard.tumblr.com/">HTML Fic Event Week</a>! check out the other fics too!
leave the creators style on (cant download it, sorry).
this should be reversii / darkmode compatible. there are two segments that are a biiiit wide on mobile, but are scrollable, so youll still see the whole item. 

this fic is basically outsider pov and beyond of canon, so, major spoilers for the entire series (duh) but especially so for s3
i dare you to click / tap on anything and everything you see here, it'll be worth it, i promise.
also,... pls leave a comment, this fic took a lot out of me

oh my god. this took so stupidly long. and then i just kept making it longer. 
ok i know that canon takes place between 2019 and 2020, but if you see an era inaccurate meme - no you didnt. rememeber kids, covid didnt exist in canon and memes are timeless!
