        Dear Parents, Guardians, and Students of St. James Middle School, <br /><br />

        In light of recent events, we are deeply saddened and concerned by the news that three students from our school community have been reported missing. 
        This is a difficult time for us all, and our hearts go out to the families of 
        Anne Boonchuy, Sasha Waybright, and Marcy Wu. <br /><br />

        We recognize that this situation may be causing a range of emotions among our students. 
        To provide support, our school counselor, Dr. Penelope, 
        will be available to speak with any students who may need a listening ear or a safe space to process their feelings. 
        She is available during school hours and can be reached at the main office or by appointment. <br /><br />

        We encourage parents and guardians to talk openly with their children about any concerns they may have and to reach out if additional support is needed. Keeping our students safe, informed, and supported remains our utmost priority. Teachers and staff are also here to help, and we are committed to fostering an environment of compassion and understanding. <br /><br />

        If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our administration. <br /><br />

        Sincerely, <br />
        Principal Kim Murphy, St. James Middle School <br />

        <span>Local Authorities Search for Missing Children, Community Urged to Help </span> <br /><br />

        Los Angeles, California – Local authorities are intensifying the search for Anne Boonchuy, Sasha Waybright, and Marcy Wu, three 13-year-old girls from St. James Middle School. All were last seen wearing their school's uniform.<br /><br />

        Authorities have canvassed the area, distributed flyers, and set up a hotline for any information on the children's whereabouts. LAPD is urging anyone who may have seen them or witnessed any suspicious activity in the area to come forward. <br /><br />

        “Our primary concern is bringing the three children back home safely,” the lead detective on the case stated in a press briefing. “We are asking for the public’s assistance and encourage residents to remain vigilant.” <br /><br />

        Parents of the missing children have sent an urgent plea to anyone who knows anything about the misisng girls to come forward. The three girls have been best friends since Kindergarten, and were always seens as "the life of the party" at St. James Middle School. <br /><br />

        The case remains active, and police urge anyone with information to contact the Missing Persons Unit or report anonymously through LAPD's tip line service. Updates will be posted as more information becomes available. <br /><br />

        The source of the robot invasion in downtown LA is unknown. People are speculating anything from foreign countries declaring war, to frogs mutated by toxic human waste, to aliens. People are confused about what happened and why, but casualties have been lower than they could have been. Witnesses claim that the robots fought amongst themselves before being destroyed, but no one has been able to piece the full truth yet, as the story is still developing. 
        <br /><br />
        With grants by the US government to rebuild the city, people are looking forward to the future. A lot of schools have had to shut down and turn to homeschooling until the buildings can be operational again. Despite the promise to return to business as usual as soon as possible, many long time residents plan to leave. Marcy Wu, student, says “My parents want to move from here – I mean, they were planning to move from before, but I convinced them to delay moving by a few months. Now they really really want to move. Even though there was a lot of destruction, I made a lot of good memories here, my friends are here. I'm gonna miss it all. Not the destruction though.”

                    This isnt some stunt bc the elections are close right? Unite the people with a common threat so that the sitting president can appear tough on war or invaders or whatever? <br /><br />
                    Or maybe a giant money scheme? Imagine how much free money the city is gonna get from the government to rebuild itself. <br /><br />

            I saw some mutant aliens on a flat screen tv when they were playing the blackpink song in the plaza in the middle of the froggmageddon, and i could never figure out why they did that. I wonder if it was some teaser promo that was playing on the screen for a movie that was eventually canceled? Idk

        <span>my therapist said i should try writing my thoughts and feelings out more often, even though its been a few months already, sooo here goes. I miss the Plantars a lot. Yesterday I saw a meme of hoppop on the internet and I broke down crying bc it was from a different angle than the pics I have on my phone. I know i was strict with them bc i didnt want them appearing in public, but now i wish polly went viral like sprig and hoppop did just so that i can discover photos of her i havent seen yet even though theyre all gone. Wow do i sound like my parents?? ugh.  </span><br /><br />
        <span>Sasha got assigned to a different high school, Marcy is moving away, and the plantars are gone, and i dunno what to do with my life anymore after all that. Like theres a void where there wasnt before.  </span><br /><br />

        <span>I know the plantars arent DEAD dead, but i feel like im mourning them any way. Im gonna talk to terri and see if we should work together with mr x to build another portal to amphibia? maybe sasha and marcy can help too. Like i know it can take years, so we better start soon.  </span><br /><br />
        <span>WAIT how long do frogs live??? </span><br /><br />
        <span>Maybe in amphibia their lifespans are longer than earth frogs?? ? Andrias WAS alive for a thousand years... </span>

            <p>So u know how st james academy had 3 run away girls? 
                One of them – anne boonchuy – is apparently on the fbis person of interest list. 
                On a fucking no fly list. Why??? Did she have the same name as a terrorist?
                 None that i could find.

            <p>Anyway, she disappeared for a few months and her family had said in some local interview 
                that she went to her aunts farm to help out, but i think thats just a cover story.

            <p>If shes not missing anymore, this isnt even a cold case. Why are you digging into this? Go touch some grass bro. Or at least investigate a REAL cold case instead of a fake one.</p>

            <p>Anyway, the day before anne and her friends went missing, they were in trouble at school for throwing a kpop dance party. Specifically they played blackpink.
                <br /><br />
                They also played blackpink in downtown los angelos during the frogpocalypse??? 
                <br /><br />
                Think about it.
