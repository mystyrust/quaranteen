        <span>Local Authorities Search for Missing Children, Community Urged to Help </span> <br /><br />

        Los Angeles, California – Local authorities are intensifying the search for Anne Boonchuy, Sasha Waybright, and Marcy Wu, three 13-year-old girls from St. James Middle School. All were last seen wearing their school's uniform.<br /><br />

        Authorities have canvassed the area, distributed flyers, and set up a hotline for any information on the children's whereabouts. LAPD is urging anyone who may have seen them or witnessed any suspicious activity in the area to come forward. <br /><br />

        “Our primary concern is bringing the three children back home safely,” the lead detective on the case stated in a press briefing. “We are asking for the public’s assistance and encourage residents to remain vigilant.” <br /><br />

        Parents of the missing children have sent an urgent plea to anyone who knows anything about the misisng girls to come forward. The three girls have been best friends since Kindergarten, and were always seens as "the life of the party" at St. James Middle School. <br /><br />

        The case remains active, and police urge anyone with information to contact the Missing Persons Unit or report anonymously through LAPD's tip line service. Updates will be posted as more information becomes available. <br /><br />

        The source of the robot invasion in downtown LA is unknown. People are speculating anything from foreign countries declaring war, to frogs mutated by toxic human waste, to aliens. People are confused about what happened and why, but casualties have been lower than they could have been. Witnesses claim that the robots fought amongst themselves before being destroyed, but no one has been able to piece the full truth yet, as the story is still developing. 
        <br /><br />
        With grants by the US government to rebuild the city, people are looking forward to the future. A lot of schools have had to shut down and turn to homeschooling until the buildings can be operational again. Despite the promise to return to business as usual as soon as possible, many long time residents plan to leave. Marcy Wu, student, says “My parents want to move from here – I mean, they were planning to move from before, but I convinced them to delay moving by a few months. Now they really really want to move. Even though there was a lot of destruction, I made a lot of good memories here, my friends are here. I'm gonna miss it all. Not the destruction though.”

        Dear Parents, Guardians, and Students of St. James Middle School, <br /><br />

        In light of recent events, we are deeply saddened and concerned by the news that three students from our school community have been reported missing. 
        This is a difficult time for us all, and our hearts go out to the families of 
        Anne Boonchuy, Sasha Waybright, and Marcy Wu. <br /><br />

        We recognize that this situation may be causing a range of emotions among our students. 
        To provide support, our school counselor, Dr. Penelope, 
        will be available to speak with any students who may need a listening ear or a safe space to process their feelings. 
        She is available during school hours and can be reached at the main office or by appointment. <br /><br />

        We encourage parents and guardians to talk openly with their children about any concerns they may have and to reach out if additional support is needed. Keeping our students safe, informed, and supported remains our utmost priority. Teachers and staff are also here to help, and we are committed to fostering an environment of compassion and understanding. <br /><br />

        If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our administration. <br /><br />

        Sincerely, <br />
        Principal Kim Murphy, St. James Middle School <br />
    </p>
