<p>Danny woke with a chill <em>deep</em> in his bones. He wasn’t sure if it was the ghostly kind of chill or not. He shivered, but no fog of breath escaped his mouth – no ghosts nearby. Danny wondered if he was sick. Sam had theorized that since his injuries healed fast, his body could probably fight off germs and bacteria at a faster than normal rate. He’d only had ectoplasm in his system for a year, and he didn’t fall sick last winter, so she could be right. </p>

<p>His winter break was surprisingly relaxing – the ghosts were oddly quiet during winter break, which let Danny catch up on sleep. His parents also didn’t fight about Santa this year – which was great! – because they were convinced that Santa was a special type of ghost like Phantom – less great.  </p>

<p>Maybe the upcoming CAT exams were just stressing him out more than he realized. Danny was only a sophomore, but all his teachers were already hounding his class with the importance of standardized test scores for college admissions. </p>

<p>So he was surprised to notice that several of his classmates were absent – Danny only noticed because <em>Dash,</em> his part time bully, was in school yesterday but absent today. The football jock would need to take the CAT exam even if he somehow managed to get scouted for a school’s team. It had been a few days since Winter Break had ended, so most people had already come back from whatever out of town trips they’d taken. Five classmates being absent on the same day was unusual. </p>

<p>“As I’m sure you’re aware, there's a new strain of flu going around,” Mr. Lancer said at homeroom. </p>

<p>Danny was <em>not</em> aware, but it made sense; he was feeling a little cold, maybe he caught it too. </p>

<p>“Be sure to take your flu shots, and if you feel sick, please visit the Casper High nurse. Especially if your symptoms are ghostly.” </p>

<p>Now <em>that</em> raised eyebrows and questions. A clamor of hands and voices went up, asking Mr. Lancer “<em>what do you mean ghostly</em>,” and Danny was relieved to find out he wasn’t the only one out of the loop for once. </p>

<p>“Several incidents of ecto-contamination were noted amongst our student body,” Mr. Lancer explained. “We do not know how contagious it is or how it spreads, and symptoms vary from each student. Most have traditional flu symptoms to varying degrees, and <em>all</em> of them have exhibited mild ghostly abilities beyond their control.” </p>

<p>“‘Ghostly abilities’? Do you mean ghost powers? Does this mean we’d get cool ghost powers?” Paulina asked. </p>

<p>“‘Cool ghost powers’ or not, ecto-contamination is radiation in your body that is potentially breaking it down from the inside out; it is meant to be taken seriously young lady!” </p>

<p>Would those affected turn into ghosts… permanently? Was it fatal? Who was patient zero? How long did it take to spread from one person to the next? </p>

<p>Since there were no ghost attacks for the entire first half of the day, it was all Danny could think about. He’d been feeling chills on and off for a while, and a dreadful part of him wondered if <em>he</em> was patient zero, spreading a new disease to everyone around him. </p>

<p>“You guys <em>are</em> wearing your Specter Deflectors, right?” Danny asked when he met Sam and Tucker for lunch. It should at least protect them from the ‘ghostly’ part of the ghost bug.</p>

<p>“Yes we are, fashion police,” Sam set her lunch tray down and lifted the hem of her sweater, showing the belt shining underneath. It was easier to hide it underneath their clothing with the cold weather. </p>

<p>“You know, I was thinking a Specter Deflector <em>bracelet</em> or <em>watch</em> would be smaller and easier to blend in with everyday clothing,” Tucker said. “But I don’t know how the belt works and I don’t want to take this apart to find out, in case I break it.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I could grab extras for you from the lab,” </p>

<p>“And accidentally shock yourself in front of your parents? Not a good idea, Danny,” </p>

<p>The Specter Deflector only shocked him when it was <em>powered on</em> and when it touched his <em>bare</em> skin. </p>

<p>“It’s fine! The weather’s still cold enough, so it’s not even suspicious to wear hoodies all the time!” Danny could easily use his clothes as a barrier.</p>

<p>Even if it looked suspicious to wear full sleeved shirts all the time in the summer, it minimized chances of Sam and Tucker’s Specter Deflectors accidentally shocking Danny; it let him continue hanging out with his best friends, <em>and</em> it was good for hiding any unhealed injuries – yes, even from Sam and Tucker.</p>

<p>Wait, if Danny had a loophole around Specter Deflectors, did the ghost bug have a loophole around it too? Did that mean Sam and Tucker <em>weren’t</em> actually safe? </p>

<p>A clang, followed by the sound of laughter, interrupted Danny’s spiraling train of thought. </p>

<p>“What? Piled too much food that you couldn’t hold your tray?” </p>

<p>“It just <em>slipped</em> okay?” </p>

<p>Some taller athletes were joking at the expense of a “geek” who dropped his lunch tray. He looked familiar, but Danny couldn’t place a name to the face. Danny tensed – should he get up and help the kid, thereby making himself a target of the athletes, or should he stay silent and thankful that he currently wasn’t a target? </p>

<p>“Is it a Freshman dork thing to do? To drop everything you’re holding? Like how Fenturd did during labs last year?” The football athletes laughed, and Danny decided that maybe it <em>was</em> better to not get involved – Dash may have been absent, but his posse wasn’t. </p>

<p>Luckily, the lunch lady stepped in to diffuse the situation. “Alright kid, if you didn’t like the mystery meat you coulda just said so, here’s another tray for ya. Now move along kids! I have a cafeteria to feed.”</p>

<p>The lunch line moved around the spill and was forgotten in the next few minutes. Danny breathed a sigh of relief. </p>

<p>“But seriously, that meat can’t be good for you,” Sam said. “Even the Nasty Burger is probably healthier than that mystery meat,” </p>

<p>For once, Tucker was in agreement, and Danny laughed. </p>

<p>The rest of the school day went… better. No ‘detention’, no ghost attacks; maybe Danny actually had a chance of getting an extra hour or two of sleep tonight. </p>

<p>It was on his way out of school, when he walked past the nurse’s office, that Danny’s ghost sense frosted his breath. Maybe going a whole school day without a single ghost <em>was</em> too much to ask for. </p>

<p>He looked around frantically – he could usually tell <em>where </em>the ghost was coming from and how powerful it was, but this time he couldn’t. Either the ghost was strong enough to hide its aura from Danny’s senses or… </p>

<p>Danny tiptoed to peek inside the nurse’s office. </p>

<p>It was the guy who dropped his lunch tray earlier – <em>Lester</em>, Danny finally remembered. Despite being a year younger, he was in the same math class as Danny. </p>

<p>There were books and papers scattered across the floor. </p>

<p>“I <em>feel</em> fine, but –” a pen slipped out of Lester’s hand. “ – whatever this is, it’s gotten worse.” </p>

<p>“We should get you to the hospital, as soon as possible,” the nurse said. “There’s an ambulance outside. We’ll call your parents and tell them you’re being admitted.”</p>

<p>“Wha–? Is this the new ghost bug that’s been going around town?” </p>

<p>“Most likely, yes,” </p>

<p>“But I haven’t even been near anyone who was sick today? Or the past few days! How did I catch it?”</p>

<p>Danny didn’t hear the rest of their conversation; he hid behind the lockers at the end of the hallway as Lester and the nurse stepped outside. He didn’t <em>mean</em> to eavesdrop, but he was confused when his ghost sense led him towards Lester. </p>

<p>The next day, Lester was absent from school – he was in a quarantined wing at North Mercy hospital to treat the ‘ghost bug’. The football jocks who accosted Lester at lunch yesterday were ordered to wear face masks at school and at practice. The athletes did not like that; they started blaming each other for ‘infecting the dweeb’ and Danny started to tune them out after they began to speculate who would be the next infected by ‘dweeb cooties’.</p>

<p>Sam and Danny spent their study hall scoping out who’d been out of school ‘sick’ and hospitalized, while Tucker searched up blueprints and layouts of the local hospital.</p>

<p>“Let’s visit the hospital after school today,” </p>

<p>Danny wanted to go to the hospital <em>during</em> school at first – it’s not like a ghost incident ever stopped him from ditching classes before – but he might need Sam and Tucker’s insight into what was going on, and he didn’t want to go without them. </p>

<p>But Sam was going to the hospital first. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, <em>finally</em> Danny had something he could do to help. He knew how to deal with someone being overshadowed, he could totally help! But not in the ambulance, in the presence of other doctors, other <em>people</em>. Danny would most likely have to wait till Sam got her own room in the hospital.</p>

<p>There was just a single period of class left; Danny saw no point in waiting till after school to check out the hospital. A quick trip to the bathroom let him transform, and a short flight later, he was in front of the hospital. </p>

<p>Since he could easily phase through walls, Danny continued flying, but was surprised at the impact of the brick walls. He tried entering the building from the left side, the right side, above – and he couldn’t get in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Danny flew back to Casper High, and returned back to class from his ‘bathroom break’ – which surprised his teacher, who expected Danny to be gone the entire period given Danny’s previous track record. </p>

<p>“Please don’t fake sick to get in,” Tucker whispered.</p>

<p>“What other choice do I have?” </p>

<p>Tucker was afraid of hospitals – well, he was afraid of needles and blood – and Danny didn’t want his friend to face all of that at once. Not to mention how hard it would be for Tucker to fake the ghost bug symptoms. </p>

<p>It was a lot easier for Danny – he didn’t have to ‘fake’ his powers, and acting clumsy in front of others came naturally to him. After ‘accidentally’ turning his arm invisible led to a quick trip to the nurse’s office, he was on his way to his own ambulance ride to the hospital. </p>

<p>Just like he thought, Danny was able to get into the hospital in his human form. </p>

<p>Danny had been admitted to the hospital as a patient before, but this was different from the time he went to the emergency room from the lab accident – he was alone this time, was expected to stay multiple nights, and the nurse asked him a lot more questions than he was used to answering. Danny had to remember to keep showing ‘symptoms’ from time to time, and his ‘shivering’ really sold it. After the nurse was satisfied with how much information she collected from him, he was given a wheelchair and escorted into his own private room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the nurse <em>finally</em> left him alone, Danny immediately left his room and walked around his wing. His name was printed on a placecard, hanging next to his room number – finding Sam should be easy. </p>

<p>He walked around the hall nearest his room, hiding behind carts whenever he spotted a nurse walk by. He recognized some names on the door. Some people from his history class. Lester. Paulina. Dash. </p>

<p>Jazz. </p>

<p>He burst into the room. </p>

<p>“Jazz?!” </p>

<p>When did she get here? Jazz drove him to school only twice a week and left home earlier the other days, so it was normal not to see her before leaving for school. Sometimes she stayed late after school, so it was normal not to see her after school either. When was the last time he’d seen Jazz?</p>

<p>“Danny!? Oh no, if you’re here, Mom and Dad are at home alone, they must be freaking out!” </p>

<p>“Oh man,” He remembered how angry their parents were at both him and Jazz when he got admitted to the hospital after his accident. “They blame ghosts on everything and for once they might be right but they’ll blame it on m– the ghost boy!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s the ghost boy’s fault,” Jazz said. “But no one’s asking for Mom and Dad’s expertise or calling them in as consultants or <em>anything</em>, and they’re home alone while <em>both</em> their kids are in the hospital because of a ghost disease,...” Jazz sighed. “I’ve barely seen any hospital staff since yesterday morning, I think they might be understaffed, too,” </p>

<p><em>Yesterday morning?</em> She’s been in the hospital for over a day? He swore he saw her this morning before leaving the house… Right? Or was he so used to keeping to himself because of how often he snuck away to fight ghosts that he didn’t even notice that he hadn’t seen his sister for a couple days? </p>

<p>“Jazz, I’m –”</p>

<p>“Can you get the thermos from my bag?” Jazz interrupted. </p>

<p>“Thermos?” Danny did as he was asked, opening Jazz’s bag and rummaging through her books until he found it. “I didn’t know you carried a Fenton thermos around,” </p>

<p>“Take it,”</p>

<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not really that useful in my hands right now,” Jazz tried to zip her bag close, but her hand went right through. “I kinda don’t have hands to hold it,”</p>

<p>Right,... that was his fault.  </p>

<p>“I’ll… I’ll fix this, Jazz. Somehow.” He didn’t know how to reassure his sister, and himself, without it sounding like an empty promise. </p>

<p>“Be careful, Danny,” </p>

<p>How could she be concerned about him when he hadn’t even noticed she was admitted to the hospital? It might’ve even been <em>his</em> fault, if the ghost bug snuck into town during a time he slacked on patrol.</p>

<p>Danny left the room with a forlorn weight on his shoulders, eyes cast downward – and immediately bumped into a nurse. </p>

<p>“What are you doing outside your –”</p>

<p>“I was just looking for the bathro–”</p>

<p>“ –without a mask?!” </p>

<p>The nurse pulled out a disposable facemask from her cart and immediately handed one to Danny. </p>

<p>“Don’t stay out of your room too long, kid. It’s boring being cooped up, I get it, but you don’t want to accidentally spread this bug to anyone else,”</p>

<p>A beep from her pocket summoned her attention, and she ran in the direction she was initially walking towards. Like Jazz thought, the hospital must be understaffed, if the nurse wasn’t going to personally make sure Danny made it back to his room – which left him free to check up on Sam, at least. </p>

<p>Sam’s room was a two turns and a couple hallways away from Jazz’s room, and looked much the same on the inside, but the scene inside the room couldn’t be any more different.</p>

<p>“Hey Danny,”</p>

<p>“Sam?!”</p>

<p>Danny’s eyes were drawn to the restraints. Sam’s “ghostly symptom” was floating, so she had to be strapped to the bed. Her legs were tied to each bed post, and her arms were – not <em>chained</em>, but still bound. It was loose enough for her to comfortably hold her phone in front of her and use it, but the setup looked eerily close to a nightmare Danny’s had many times before. </p>

<p>“Apparently if I want to use the bathroom I have to buzz for a nurse.” </p>

<p>“Well, if I can help it, you won’t even need to be here,” </p>

<p>Danny transformed. </p>

<p>“If it’s a bee, or mosquito, or whatever, that’s overshadowing you… then I can help.” </p>

<p>Though Danny barely uses his overshadowing powers, Sam and Tucker helped him train it a bit when he first discovered it, so they knew what to expect. He closed his eyes and slowly phased his arm through Sam’s stomach.</p>

<p>A deep breath, to concentrate, then he opened his eyes – his glow just a little brighter, his pupils greener than before, and his <em>voice</em> more ethereal. </p>

<p>“G̸e̸t̵ ̶o̶u̷t̸”</p>

<p>No matter what type of ghost was inside Sam, animalistic or humanoid, it should have <em>heard</em> him. It should figure out that Danny was (most likely) the more powerful of the two ghosts and leave the body alone – after all, only the weakest of ghosts resorted to possessing bodies.</p>

<p>But instead of obeying his ‘command’, Danny heard another one in response. </p>

<p>ú̸͍́̕s̸̨̬̫͙̊̇̆ȩ̴͇̐́̃͝r̷̩̆͆͆͝ ̸̛̣̤̈́͗̑̕n̸̨̬̈́͌͌ò̵͎t̸̨̳͙̥͠ͅ ̷̖̗͎͕͂͂͛r̷̛̤̐͑͌͐ḛ̷̭̼̲̞́̔̔c̴̥̠̥̝̲͑ỏ̵̲̹̺g̵̢̨̡̭̑n̴̢̟̙̜̘̂̄͒͆̔ḭ̵̰̝̍̂̾̍z̵̼͙͉̤̼̈́̈̉͝ẻ̸̼̀̌͘ḏ̷̜͚̐̊͑́̇ͅ.̸͓̆̌ ̴͓̼̯͍͗͊̔̄̇p̷̧͉͉͉͍̂̆͝l̷̼̭̄̅̿̚ͅė̷̦͇̰̾̈ä̷͔̪̰́̑͛̑͜s̵̲̙̒̊̃ę̶́̊͋͠ ̵̬̣̱͠e̸̲̜̋n̸͎͖̘̘̾̈́̓t̸̯̿̎̓͝ͅẻ̶͓̤̏r̸̮͖̫͓͂ͅ ̶̦̀̎͛̉͛p̴͙̿̓̅͌̚ä̶̲̬͇̥̬͗̕͘s̵̛͓͒̂͠s̷̺̿̐̈́͑͠w̸̗̣͈̼̹͋ȯ̵̞̱̍ṟ̶̅̋̄͝d̷̬̲̟̘͓̏́̋́͂.̵̦̾́̇͐͘</p>

<p>It was a very incoherent thought – almost too powerful to have come from a single ‘fly’. He yanked his hand out of Sam.</p>

<p>“It… <em>They</em> won’t listen,” </p>

<p>A few facts became very clear to Danny from the mental backlash:</p><ol> 
<li>They were working <em>under</em> someone. A powerful ghost, possibly more powerful than him. </li>
<li>All the flies were working together, almost like a hivemind</li>
</ol>

<p>They must’ve been imprinted beforehand with instructions to follow, preventing Danny from scaring them out with his own aura. </p>

<p>Danny explained his conclusions to Sam. </p>

<p>“So, I gotta take out the hivemind. Kill their queen. This is just like chess! Or real life mosquitos!” </p>

<p>“Technically wrong on both metaphors Danny,”</p>

<p>“Whatever! if I take out their boss – the one responsible for this – then they’ll listen to me and get out of everyone.”</p>

<p>Danny quickly texted Tucker his updated plan, and referenced the hospital blueprints and notes that he had helpfully provided earlier. He doesn’t ‘know’ where the ‘hivemind’ or ‘queen’ would be, but he imagines his best chance would be to scope the area with the highest security clearance. Even if there’s no ‘hivemind’ there, he’s bound to find information or answers.</p>

<p>Tucker noted that the hospital’s inhouse testing lab only allowed clearance to two scientists – who were from out of town. </p>

<p>But <em>not</em> the local ghost experts? Wouldn’t they want as many hands on deck as possible? As many minds as it could take to solve the problem? Danny found the map labeled in Tucker’s map. A short three minute flight later, phasing through walls and doors, and Danny was inside the lab. </p>

<p>Tucker had given him a usb flash drive to copy data into, but Danny would need to wait until the researchers came back into the room. Either invisibly peer over their shoulders to copy their passwords and find the important file locations, or overshadow them for any fingerprints or face scans that might block his way – there was nothing secure from Danny’s powers. </p>

<p>He looked around the empty lab for any computer, but got distracted. It wasn’t the rows and rows of test tubes that caught his eye; it was the shelves full of flies in jars in the back – mosquitoes that glowed with an ecto-green hue. Why would they have…?</p>

<p>Did they get a head start on researching the disease by catching the mosquitos? But why would they have <em>so many</em>? Unless… they weren’t researching this disease, they were responsible for its outbreak. </p>

<p>Danny’s suspicion was proven true when one of the secured doors hissed open. He covered his mouth as his ghost sense fogged his breath, making sure to also turn invisible. A black haired woman entered the lab, followed by a shorter man behind her. But then she took off her lab coat and twirled her hair – Danny nearly gasped as the color changed to red and arranged itself into a familiar updo.</p>

<p>“Bertrand, how many new patients did we get today?” </p>

<p>“Thirteen – six from Casper High, three from the middle school across the street, and four from the gym,” </p>

<p>Spectra. </p>

<p>Originally, she had posed as a (very unpleasant) school psychologist at Casper High, before Danny defeated her. She must’ve gotten stronger, if she upgraded from making people mentally and emotionally sick to <em>physically</em> sick.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Danny felt entirely unprepared. He had been an emotional wreck for a while after Spectra’s stint at Casper High. </p>

<p>“Good, we don’t want to be too – <em>oh</em>,” She sniffed the air gleefully. “Oh Bertrand, we have a little <em>rat</em> in here!” </p>

<p>Danny covered his mouth, even though he didn’t need to breathe in ghost form. </p>

<p>Spectra walked right next to him. Then bent down and stared him in the eye.</p>

<p>“Long time no see, Phantom!” </p>

<p>Danny looked down at himself – he <em>was</em> still invisible, so how did she-? He jumped out of the way of a hand grab to his shoulder, maintaining invisibility, but her head and eyes tracked his movements.</p>

<p>“The anxiety reeking off you could keep me going for days,” </p>

<p>Spectra gained power from negative emotions – and she could use that to pinpoint where he was, invisibility be damned. </p>

<p>He threw an invisible punch, but she dodged it effortlessly. </p>

<p>“Wh-What? What are you <em>doing</em> here? Why?” Danny tried to sound menacing but he couldn’t hide the fear escaping into his voice. </p>

<p>“Making my own food, of course. After you ruined me, I regained strength by eating the anxiety of long term hospital patients. But that tasted boring after I got strong enough,” </p>

<p>‘Eating anxiety’ was how Spectra gained power. </p>

<p>“I wanted more, so I <em>had</em> to come back to my roots,”</p>

<p>“I beat you before, and I can beat you again!” Could he fake his confidence enough to face off against Spectra – or would she see right through it? </p>

<p>Danny dropped his invisibility, hoping to concentrate his power on ecto-powered punches or kicks – he didn’t dare throw any ectobeams, he <em>was </em>trying to get data from the hospital’s servers after all. Her nails extended into sharp claws, swiping back at him. </p>

<p>“Who made those flies? Your assistant?” </p>

<p>Bertrand had since shed his human disguise, hovering behind his queen and waiting for an order.</p>

<p>“Your assistant who you can’t fight without? And, eating the emotions of humans – you’re nothing without others!” Danny smiled smugly. </p>

<p>“And you’re nothing even <em>with</em> others,” Spectra said. “Genius parents, genius sister – not genius enough to know what happened to you, but genius enough to remind you that you aren’t one.” Danny gasped, his punch thrown off course. </p>

<p>“Despite living with geniuses, you’re the family idiot! Isn’t it amazing how none of their smarts rubbed off on you?” </p>

<p>She invaded Danny’s personal space, cradling his chin with her hand. He should say something back, something punny or clever, but he doesn’t have the words – because what she said was true, after all. </p>

<p>“I was just planning on having the bugs infect their hosts for a few days, and then they’d mysteriously get better, and I’d leave! I don’t actually want to <em>kill</em> anybody – if I did, you’d be dead already! No, I prefer humans living in fear – teenagers have the best anxiety!”</p>

<p>Spectra cackled as Danny was filled with all sorts of emotions he couldn’t bury. Hurt, confusion, fear. He couldn’t fake confidence at school; he couldn’t fake confidence to save his life. </p>

<p>“You know, it wasn’t <em>my</em> idea to quarantine the ecto-infected patients – it was the hospital’s decision. Guess they really do hate ghosts, huh? They really <em>do</em> hate you.”  </p>

<p>Danny wanted to say it <em>wasn’t</em> true, that people <em>don’t</em> hate him – but the ones that don’t hate him were currently infected with a never before seen ecto-disease, and if they didn’t hate him yet, they might soon. He couldn’t blame people for thinking a ghost bug was Phantom’s fault – he was the only ghost who frequented human places, and attempted to fraternize with humans. </p>

<p>Spectra didn’t even need to tell him anything, he was capable of catastrophizing all by himself. </p>

<p>“I can’t have you ruining my operation here though. Not went it <em>just</em> started getting good results,” </p>

<p>Why did Danny think he even stood a chance against her? He fired a tiny ectoblast, putting distance between them, and then dashed upwards. He barely flew a few feet out of the ceiling when he hit solid air, which rippled green where he hit it – oh right, ghost shield. </p>

<p>Spectra flew in from below.</p>

<p>“No matter where you run, I’ll find you! Your emotions are my compass, and you’re the north star, <em>Danny</em>.” </p>

<p>He flew back down – maybe he could lose her in the hospital. He always masked his emotions with comedic quips, but his mind was <em>not</em> his friend right now, especially when it was bouncing between fight or flight mode faster than he could blink. </p>

<p>Maybe he could hide out in the patient ward. Every patient had anxiety, and maybe he could muddle Spectra’s empathy sense from finding him; but if her empathy sense was anything like his ghost sense, he wouldn’t slow her down much, and he would be found eventually. He was basically using the patients like a shield, no better than a bad guy using hostages to keep himself safe, and Danny <em>hated</em> that it was the first comparison his brain came up with. </p>

<p>He wished The Flash were here to come up with some plan of attack, or The Red Huntress to tell him that the ghost was spewing nonsense and help strategize with him. </p>

<p>But wait, The Red Huntress <em>was</em> here.</p>

<p>Valerie Gray was checked into the hospital; Danny had passed by her room earlier. Maybe she had some of her ghost weapons or gadgets with her, stuff that Danny could use for an element of surprise. </p>

<p>It didn’t take long for him to find her room. Valerie was cuddled with bundles of blankets, snot dripping down her face – unlike Lester, Sam, and even Jazz, she actually looked sick. But there was the telltale sign of the ghost bug too – her skin glowed, much like the glow Danny’s ghost form has, and her hair was <em>white</em>. </p>

<p>She pointed a wrist ray at him.</p>

<p>“What–” She sneezed.</p>

<p>“Bless you.” </p>

<p>“No don’t bless me! What are you doing here?” She sounded annoyed and tired, but Danny didn't miss the shiver in her voice; she was scared too.</p>

<p>“What other ghost weapons do you have on you?” Danny asked. </p>

<p>“What?” </p>

<p>“I don’t have much time to explain, I need help and I don't know who else to ask!” </p>

<p>Danny briefly explained that there was another ghost in the hospital – that this ghost was responsible for everyone getting infected – and she was after him. </p>

<p>Valerie pulled aside her backpack, and Danny took stock of her inventory: a thermos, some phase proof netting, a couple wrist rays, and a ghost detector. None of the big machinery she usually carries around with her when she’s out as The Red Huntress, but this would have to do. </p>

<p>She opened up her ghost detector, and the small cell phone sized LCD screen displayed a multitude of flashing dots. </p>

<p>“Each dot is supposed to be a ghost – but it’s pinging all of us because of that ghost bug,” Valerie explained. That made sense, considering it activated his ghost sense too. But three lights were pinging brighter than the rest – one was Danny (right next to Valerie), another was far away and stationary, and the third was <em>moving,</em> slowly. It seemed to stop for a bit and approach a dot from a distance, before moving again.</p>

<p>“That one’s gotta be her,”</p>

<p>He phased one of the thermoses halfway through the ceiling, positioning it right in front of the door and making sure the suction button was visible to Valerie from her bedside, </p>

<p>He didn’t know what to do with the phase proof netting. Valerie suggested lining the walls with it to prevent the ghost from phasing in, but there wasn’t enough to line every single wall, and the ceiling wasn’t high enough to hide a complicated netted trap – not like he knew how to create one, anyway. </p>

<p>The minutes were ticking by fast. Valerie kept monitoring the ghost detector for Spectra’s inevitable entrance. </p>

<p>Danny tried to calm his nerves, but that was easier said than done. He had one last trick that<em> might</em> make it harder for Spectra to track him, but it would require a lot of trust in Valerie. He already trusted her to have his back in a fight; this <em>technically </em>wasn’t all that different.</p>

<p>There was a small closet in the room, filled with white towels and sheets; Danny took half of them out onto the chair, and sat inside. He pulled the door close into a snug fit. The angle was terrible, it faced away from the door, and he wouldn’t be able to <em>see</em> or react to Spectra.</p>

<p>“Hey Va– um, Red?” Danny said from inside the closet, clutching the other thermos in his hand. “No matter what, <em>don’t</em> open this cabinet.” </p>

<p>And he reverted to his human form.</p><hr />

<p>Valerie squeeked in surprise at the flash of bright white from beneath the closet. </p>

<p>“Phantom! What –?”</p>

<p>“Don’t look! Please! Just keep an eye out for Spectra!”</p>

<p>She looked back at the ghost detector on her lap; whatever Phantom did, his signal was nonexistent. It must be whatever trick he always used to escape from the Fentons’ ghost detectors during the day time. Valerie always hated that trick, and never thought a day would come where she’d be thankful for it. </p>

<p>There was a knocking sound, followed by “I’m opening the door!” </p>

<p>Valerie wondered what type of hideous ghost would infect humans and chase Phantom around the hospital. But instead of a ghost, it was – </p>

<p>“Dr. Isabella?”</p>

<p>“Hello dear, I just came to check up on you – apparently there’s a ghost loose in the hospital. It’s the one that spread the disease and made everyone sick, and I wanted to make sure all the patients were safe,”</p>

<p>Valerie was puzzled. Phantom said that the ghost was coming through the door any minute now. Shouldn’t the doctor take cover, or inform someone, before checking on the patients?</p>

<p>“Did a ghost come by in this room?” </p>

<p>“Oh. Uh. No?” </p>

<p>“Are you sure? Other patients mentioned its hair being as white as yours, and a dark black bodysuit?” </p>

<p>Dr. Isabella looked way too calm for checking in on a patient’s safety during a ghost emergency – an alleged ghost emergency, since there was no alarm or announcement in the hospital. All the nurses that Valerie had met the past few days were overworked, hair in messy buns and masks covering their faces, it was almost strange to see a doctor without a face mask and without a messy bun.</p>

<p>“Can I come in?” The doctor was subtly eyeing the closet – the one Phantom was in.</p>

<p>“Oh! Actually, I did see one,” Valerie interrupted. </p>

<p>“Oh? Where?” She seemed a little too eager, and a little too unarmed, to be looking for a ghost by herself.</p>

<p>“Right there.” </p>

<p>Valerie pointed at the doorway. The doctor briefly turned around, looking behind her in the direction Valerie pointed.  </p>

<p>Valerie fired her wrist ray on the ceiling above the doorway – </p>

<p>Dr. Isabella’s face morphed into a different, familiar face, snarling in anger</p>

<p>– and the thermos activated. The doctor resisted its pull, so Valerie fired a few more shots from her wrist ray, and the doctor was suctioned in. The thermos wouldn't have even activated if she were human. Valerie was almost fooled by the human look, if not for the ghost detector on her lap. </p>

<p>She breathed a sigh of relief. </p>

<p>“It worked, Phantom. Caught her in the thermos,” </p>

<p>But there was no response from the ghost hiding in her room. Valerie shuffled off her bed. </p>

<p>“Phantom?” She knocked on the door, and heard harsh breathing in response. </p>

<p>“I’m opening the door!” </p>

<p>“Wait!” the ghost rasped. A bright light flashed, leaking out from underneath the closet door. </p>

<p>The ‘ding’ from the ghost tracker she left on her bed confirmed that Phantom started to register on her equipment again. </p>

<p>A kick from inside hit the bottom of the door and it swung open; the ghost boy came out and fell to his knees, rubbing his face with the white towel that was covering his head as his breathing slowed down.  </p>

<p>Valerie never noticed it before, but he seemed to breathe an awful lot for a ghost. </p>

<p>“Are you… okay?” </p>

<p>She felt like she intruded on the beginning of a panic attack that was cut short. Phantom wasn’t in the closet for long, but all the towels were crumpled on the floor.</p>

<p>“I’m fine! I’m… I forgot that I… hated tiny spaces.” </p>

<p>Oh. Valerie wondered what he thought about the thermos.  </p>

<p>He took in a deep breath, and that casual Phantom bravado that he showed everyone slowly seemed to return in his posture.</p>

<p>“Holy shit that actually worked!” There he was. “I was afraid it wouldn’t! Also can I say I’m really glad you didn’t believe her word over mine?” </p>

<p>Maybe the Valerie of a few months ago <em>would</em> have done that. But recently there was some telltale trust she had in the ghost, something beyond reluctant allies of circumstance. With one obstacle down, they had to stay on task. </p>

<p>“So what now?” Valerie asked “Was Dr. Isabella a ghost all along? Or is there a ‘real’ Dr. Isabella that Spectra replaced?” </p>

<p>“I… don’t know. Spectra’s assistant is still around the hospital – I have to grab him too, but he’s weaker and easier to deal with than Spectra. But before I go deal with him, let me see if I can help you,” </p>

<p>He floated closer – close enough to give a bear hug, which was a little <em>too </em>close for comfort. </p>

<p>“This might tingle, but it won’t hurt. It might look freaky, but I promise I’m not hurting you,” </p>

<p>And then he stabbed her with his hand. </p>

<p>Except it <em>wasn’t</em> a stab; his hand went through her stomach, and it <em>did</em> tingle.</p>

<p>Phantom’s eyes glowed a bright green, bright as a traffic light, and he seemed to speak… <em>to</em> something, words laced with static that she could barely make out. After a moment, he pulled his hand out, frustration evident in his face. </p>

<p>“It didn’t work.”</p><hr />

<p><em>Why</em> didn’t it work? He defeated the queen bee, so the ecto-hivemind inhabiting the patients should dissolve, or obey him and leave. It was a checkmate! </p>

<p>Was it too soon after capturing Spectra, and the flies didn’t get the ‘news’? Bertrand was still out there; maybe Danny had to capture him too? </p>

<p>
  <em> &nbsp; He had his own thermos and he still needed help from a sick person. </em>
</p>

<p>Danny shook the thought away. Turning human in a tiny closet reminded him too much of getting stuffed into lockers by football jocks. The need to breathe that came with his human form made him feel like there wasn't enough room, there wasn’t enough <em>air</em> for his lungs. He’s not even sure if hiding his ghost form actually slowed down Spectra in tracking him down. </p>

<p>“Your ghost detector, can I see it again?” </p>

<p>Valerie showed it, and Danny tracked the other bright white dot he’d seen earlier, the stationary one he’d suspected of being Bertrand. </p>

<p>
  <em> &nbsp; If he were stronger, he would have fought and thermosed the two ghosts within the testing lab. He never would have forgotten his thermos and taken Jazz’s. He never would have ran. He wouldn’t have needed to drag Valerie into this. </em>
</p>

<p>“I’ll go deal with him, and then, then maybe it’ll work,” Danny said. </p>

<p>He took off flying towards the high security lab, where he thought Bertrand might be. Sure enough, there was the shadowy assistant, his human disguise cast aside waiting for an order from Spectra that never came. He didn’t pose much of a challenge – no taunts, no special powers, no <em>strength</em> – a few quick ecto-attacks, and Danny sucked him up in the other thermos quickly. The ghost servant and his queen bee were kept in separate thermoses – and they’d stay that way, until Danny could empty them back in the ghost zone. </p>

<p>He flew back to Valerie’s room, tried his ‘overshadowing-exorcism’ hack again; it had worked against Skulker when the hunter-ghost tried possessing Flash’s body, but the weaker mosquitos <em>still</em> refused to phase out of Valerie. </p>

<p>
  <em> &nbsp; Or, the flies knew how weak he really was. He was freaking out in Valerie’s room – if Spectra could sense that, why wouldn’t the bugs be able to? </em>
</p>

<p>No! He couldn’t afford to think like that! He owed it to Valerie – and everyone who was infected – to try his hardest, to tackle this with a clear as possible head.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in the hospital?” He finally asked.</p>

<p>“A week,” </p>

<p>Was <em>time</em> a factor? Maybe Danny needed to try someone who hadn’t been infected for as long, someone who was admitted very recently. </p>

<p>He rushed into Sam’s room, offered a brief explanation before trying again, and… nothing; there was no response from the mosquitos at all this time. Did he miss something? Danny isn’t sure the bug escaped silently; Sam was still floating, the loose restraints preventing her from floating away from her bed. </p>

<p>Something was wrong, and he didn’t know what. He normally punched or quipped or napped his problems away, but this time… he couldn’t. He needed help.</p>
