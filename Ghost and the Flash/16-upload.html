<p>Danny doesn't understand why his shivers come and go. The weather’s getting warmer, and he’s dressed in extra layers – sweaters and full sleeved shirts – so if he were <em>sweating,</em> that would have made more sense. His temperature runs colder than normal, and his new shivers were not from the chill from his ghost sense, nor from a cold, either. But his body still shivered at the oddest possible moment – especially this time. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was visiting StarLabs when Cisco raised the alarm for a building on fire. It might not have been a meta-human incident, but given that Flash and Phantom could probably rescue people fast enough, they arrived on the scene to help. </p>

<p>The two raced to the address that Cisco gave them (Flash won that race), and found a six story apartment building with smoke coming out from all the windows. The fire seemed to spill out from a couple windows on the fourth floor, but was otherwise contained within the building.</p>

<p>“Race to see who can rescue more people first?” Flash asked. </p>

<p>“Oh you’re <em>on,”</em></p>

<p>Danny had the advantage of intangibility – he could phase himself <em>and</em> anyone he rescued. Flash could only phase himself, and only through short distances. Danny wished he could duplicate himself though, like Vlad; it would make search and rescue <em>so</em> much faster in emergency situations like this. Phantom took to the higher floors first, while Flash looked for any people trapped in the lower floors, and tried to clear the fire for people to pass through. </p>

<p>Danny searched methodically in each unit he entered – he called out for names, searched in closets, bedrooms, and bathrooms in case people or pets were hiding or unconscious from smoke. He could only carry one person out of the fire at a time, but he made quick and frequent trips to get everyone out. </p>

<p>“I got 7 people out,” Flash bragged.</p>

<p>“Oh yeah? I got 11 out,” Phantom taunted.</p>

<p>They had way more to go.</p>

<p>And <em>then</em>, within the scorching heat of the building, with flames dancing right in front of him, Danny <em>shivered.</em> It wasn’t fear or tiredness or illness like he’d suspected every other time this happened – this was something else. He knew his temperature ran colder – a few of the people he saved tell him as much, because it feels like a relief for them after escaping the heat of a burning building. But the shivering <em>can’t </em>be right. Tension bubbled up his nose and he let it out with a sneeze, something came out, and in front of him was <em>ice. </em>Ecto-ice?</p>

<p>He’d seen ecto-ice just once before, and assumed it came from someone or something else at the time – but could it have been from him? </p>

<p>More importantly, could it help put out the fire? </p>

<p>He tried to summon the ice on purpose, firing a small ectobeam at the corner of the fire – but instead of ice, ectoplasm fed the flames, and the fire jumped higher.</p>

<p>He searched inside himself, for the source of the <em>shiver</em> – he felt the tension ride up his arms this time. That tension stayed in his arms for a solid minute, then a blast of ice came out of his arms. </p>

<p>A block of ice plugged the hallway on the floor. It was a double edged sword; it prevented the fire from spreading, but also prevented anyone from escaping or coming in for a rescue – except for Danny, that is. And maybe Barry, if he was warned ahead of time so that he could phase through it.</p>

<p>He could figure out this ice stuff later.</p>

<p>He doubted any rescuers would come this high – it was most probably the source of the fire, with the flames being most concentrated in a cluster of apartment units near the stairs. Danny hoped he wouldn’t find anyone charred or burned beyond recognition – Cisco had warned them early enough, no one should be in the fire long enough for that to happen. </p>

<p>Danny feared the worst when he entered an apartment in the heat of the blaze.</p>

<p>“Is anyone there?!” Danny called. </p>

<p>“I am!” A young voice cried back. “But I’m stuck! There’s too much fire I think I accidentally –” </p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that!” </p>

<p>Danny followed the sound of sobbing and found a young boy engulfed in flames. He was on fire, but he wasn’t burning; some of the fabric on his sleeves had charred off, but the flesh underneath was unharmed. </p>

<p>“How are you –?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I’m sorry I didn’t mean to! It was an accident! I was just trying to light the stove with my powers but I couldn’t control it, my sister screamed and then the wind blew in and then–”</p>

<p>“It’s okay!” Danny put a hand on the boy’s shoulders. “You’re not in trouble. Look. You can’t burn me. See?” It was tricky, using intangibility to avoid the fire but still be able to touch the boy’s skin. </p>

<p>The boy looked at him in shock. </p>

<p>“I don’t know how to turn it off!” </p>

<p>“Then, will you let me help you?”  </p>

<p>The boy nodded. </p>

<p>“Okay, close your eyes. Or at least don’t look down.” </p>

<p>Danny spread his intangibility to the boy, ignoring the fire. He flew up, holding the kid by his shoulders and phasing through the ceiling. They floated above the apartment building, above the fire; Danny could see the boy’s closed eyes watering from the smoke. The fire was still flickering in the boy's hands, but slowly losing volume. </p>

<p>“Deep breaths, can you do that for me?” the boy nodded, eyes still closed. Danny started taking exaggerated gulps of air, and the boy mimicked Danny’s breathing pattern.</p>

<p>“You’re cold, mister,” </p>

<p>“Yeah. It helps me put your fire out,” </p>

<p>With Danny’s cold temperature, the boy’s emotions calming down, and the loss of flammable material to consume, the fire in the boy’s hands calmed down until Danny was able to blow it out easily, like a candle. Danny was glad he didn’t need to use any sort of ecto-ice, which he couldn’t fully control yet, to calm the kid’s fire down.</p>

<p>“Better?”</p>

<p>The kid nodded. </p>

<p>Danny flew down to the street, away from the fire and near the fire truck, where he let the boy down. Two people, who Danny assumed were his mom and sister, immediately ran to hug him, exchanging words and sobs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the fire was put out and all tenants were accounted for, Phantom and Flash didn’t stick around for long – they zoomed straight to StarLabs to recuperate. Barry had inhaled a lot of smoke rushing in and out of the fire.</p>

<p>And Danny… </p>

<p>“Caitlyn, something’s wrong with me!” he confided in her privately. “I have ice powers?” </p>

<p>“And why would that mean something’s wrong with you?”</p>

<p>“It’s not like I’ve had <em>another</em> lab accident!” Caitlyn raised her eyebrow at the statement, but Danny ignored it. A possibly out of control power meant he’d have to dedicate extra time and energy to mastering it – extra time and energy that he didn’t have. Between patrolling Amity Park, fighting ghosts, visiting Central City, and catching up on homework, Danny was spread thin. </p>

<p>“You can phase through walls, fly, and overshadow people; I don’t see how this is any surprising,” Caitlyn responded.</p>

<p>“I’ve already had my powers for a whole year, I should have seen this before! Is my ectoplasm <em>defective</em> or something?” If he’d known about ecto-ice earlier, he could have used it against other ghosts. </p>

<p>“You’ve <em>only</em> had your powers for a year,” Caitlyn corrected. “Have you seen any other ghosts that have had ice powers?”</p>

<p>Danny was silent for a minute. </p>

<p>“...Just one, but yeah,” </p>

<p>Klemper – who also had ice powers – was annoying, but not dangerous, so Danny almost forgot about him. Okay, so Danny’s ectoplasm wasn’t necessarily mutated or defective. Maybe he can get Caitlyn and Cisco to run some tests on his ecto-ice? Once he learns how to control it a bit better, that is. </p>

<p>“But also,” Caitlyn thought. “It’s not unusual for a body to physically change drastically, especially at your age. We have no idea how your powers are affected by puberty –”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk about <em>puberty</em>!” Danny facepalmed to hide his embarrassment. </p>

<p>“Danny, I’m a doctor.” </p>

<p>Danny would rather die – again – than talk about puberty. His parents didn’t talk much about it, so what he knew came from the internet and health class. It was embarrassing just to think about, and that was <em>without</em> ghost powers acting up. </p>

<p>But that was it – the fact that he was able to have a conversation about it <em>at all</em> was only possible because Caitlyn knew about Danny’s identity. Not the half truth that he was just a ghost, but the full truth that he was only half a ghost. </p>

<p>It would also be easier to understand his new power if he told everyone in StarLabs about it – and if he was going to tell them about one new power, he might as well tell the team how he got his powers. They could understand his biology better if they had the full picture, instead of only half of it. </p>

<p>Also, it would be easier to tell them than his parents, since StarLabs had already suspected that Danny Fenton and Danny Phantom were the same. </p>

<p>He borrowed some paper and a pen from Caitlyn, and scribbled down some notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>Barry felt a lot better after breathing in fresher air and resting in the med bay. He was snacking on a protein bar next to Cisco, who was re-designing the meta-human cuffs to work as power dampeners for the kid with meta powers who accidentally set the apartment on fire. </p>

<p>Towards the end of their ‘race’ to rescue the most people, Flash and Phantom had lost count of how many each had rescued, but Barry decided to concede victory to Phantom, given that the ghost boy was able to find and calm down the source of the fire. </p>

<p>At first, Cisco had thought the apartment fire was caused by the Yellow Flash as a distraction. His custom “Yellow-Flash” alert had pinged an in-progress lab theft happening at the other end of town – but Barry had already ventured into the apartment to rescue tenants, and Phantom had later found the real source of the fire. Even if the Yellow Flash wasn’t the cause of the fire, the timing of his robbery was awfully convenient – just as Flash and Phantom were too preoccupied with a different meta. Cisco wondered what the Yellow Flash was hoping to do with all the stolen equipment. </p>

<p>If the equipment was stolen to be sold, it would have to be sold in the black market; the product ids could be searched up and the seller would be flagged if a sale was attempted through any legitimate channel. If the Yellow Flash was planning to use the equipment himself, he must be a scientist capable of doing so, maybe like Barry or Cisco were. Was there another lab accident that created a speedster out of a scientist? Cisco had a lot of research to do. </p>

<p>Dr. Wells wheeled in, and Cisco closed all his incognito browser tabs – he’d probably be able to research it better without his boss noticing him slack off. He returned to fiddling with the meta-cuff prototype. </p>

<p>“Did you find the cause of the fire?” Dr. Wells asked. He’s usually present at the console, monitoring street camera footage and providing advice through their ear comms, but had to step away (or, wheel away) to take an urgent phone call. </p>

<p>“Yeah, it was a kid with meta powers,” Barry responded. “Phantom managed to calm him down though, he’s pretty good with kids,” </p>

<p><em>Because he looks like one</em>, went unsaid.</p>

<p>“Guys?” </p>

<p>Speak of the ghost. Phantom came out of the med bay, calling for their attention. He took a deep breath. </p>

<p>“Look, there’s no easy way to say this, so can you all promise that what I say doesn’t leave this room?” </p>

<p>“You can tell us any–”</p>

<p>“You have to promise!” Phantom interrupted.</p>

<p>“Okay, okay, I promise!” </p>

<p>“All of you!” The room was filled with hasty nods and assurances. </p>

<p>Barry briefly wondered if he should suggest Phantom draft an NDA for them all to sign, but maybe legal paperwork was not a good idea to mix with a ghost, especially when Amity Park had a potential series of warrants against Phantom. He’s not sure if they’d even be considered legally binding, considering Phantom’s non-human status. </p>

<p>“Okay so. I should have told you guys this a <em>while</em> ago, ugh. It’s been enough time that I think you guys should know…” Phantom was nervous. “You know how you guys always wondered what my connection is to Danny Fenton, and why I ‘look’ like him?” </p>

<p>No matter what the answer, the ramification would be huge. </p>

<p>Phantom floated down, his feet touching the ground. Two white rings flashed across his body. A transformation, and then a different person stood in his place. </p>

<p>“It’s because I <em>am</em> Danny Fenton.” </p>

<p>Now Barry wished he brought up that NDA idea earlier. </p>

<p>Besides the sound of Barry coughing up a lung, everyone was silent. Caitlyn and Dr. Wells were silent. Cisco and Barry blinked at each other in bewilderment, as if to confirm that they both saw the same thing. Even the sound of breathing was absent from the room, as everyone held their breaths as Danny began to speak again. </p>

<p>“Before you ask: No, I’m not a fake clone who’s replacing ‘the real’ Danny Fenton. I’m not overshadowing Danny Fenton. I am, and I always <em>was</em>, Danny Fenton. And I always was Danny Phantom, too. I got into a lab accident once when I wasn’t careful, and then I had powers when I woke up.” </p>

<p>The silence carried on for another minute, and it was the longest minute of Barry's life – and for a speedster like him, a minute was practically an eternity. His thoughts literally ran a mile a minute. A lab accident? Was it in the Fentons’ basement lab? Was he also electrocuted and then lost time in a coma? Did the Fentons update their lab safety protocols after Danny's accident?</p>

<p>“So,” Cisco finally broke the silence. “No secret twin who died in the womb and aged alongside you as a ghost?” </p>

<p>“...No.” Danny said. “That’s a new one. I think if I had a twin my parents would have told me – actually, would they have told me? They would, right? I never saw anything like that in my old baby pictures,”</p>

<p>“Then, I take it that your parents… don’t know, do they?” Dr. Wells asked. “They don’t know what you just told us?”</p>

<p>The brief chuckles among the group died down.</p>

<p>“...No,”</p>

<p>“Why not?” </p>

<p>“It’s complicated! Barry, you and Iris met my parents, what do you think? Cisco? Caitlyn?” Danny looked each person in the eye. “Do you think they’d take this news well?”</p>

<p>Cisco looked like he wanted to say something, his hands half gestured, but then quit. </p>

<p>“Then why didn't you tell your parents the moment you noticed something had changed? The moment you got your powers?” Barry finally asked, after a moment of brief silence. </p>

<p>Barry had told Joe about his powers less than a day after waking up from his coma. Cisco, Caitlyn, and Dr. Wells helped him learn and navigate his powers every step of the way. If his foster father was still alive, he’d tell him instantly. Danny was lucky that his parents were masters in the sciences, parents that would foster and encourage a scientific career. Parents that could research and understand the unknown in a way that no one else could. Danny was lucky that he still had his parents around, something Barry so desperately wished for. </p>

<p>“It's not the same, Barry. Because when people see The Flash, they see a living breathing human being underneath the suit. When they see <em>me</em>, they see a cryptid, the cause of all the property damage in town. </p>

<p>They don't even know that there's a human behind Phantom. He’s a ghost, he’s dead, so why would they look for someone <em>alive</em>? All the tabloids have been looking into accidental deaths from the last 50 years, so it’s made it easy for me to hide in plain sight, but harder to tell people, tell <em>anyone</em>, about,... <em>this,</em>”</p>

<p>He transformed again into the form they were all familiar with. </p>

<p>“So… who <em>does</em> know?” Dr. Wells asked after a beat of silence.</p>

<p>“A couple friends of mine, and now, you guys,” Phantom gestured to the entire group. “I just wanted to finally tell you guys because… I guess it’s practice for when I <em>do</em> tell my parents. And I guess it’d be nice to have a little more help with figuring out how my powers work with the help of people who <em>know – </em>know about both sides of me. I don’t exactly know <em>what</em> I am.”  </p>

<p>While experts, the Fentons’ shortsighted nature may skew how they view their son’s two sides – how they view their <em>son</em>. And, when Phantom had gotten hurt by Hartley’s sonic attacks, Caitlyn was operating on pure guesswork to figure out how to help the ghost boy. Barry was beginning to see a clearer logic to Phantom’s choice of revealing himself – of <em>who </em>he chose to reveal himself to. And… there wasn’t much point in wondering what would have happened if he’d made different choices – that regret wasn’t gonna help Phantom right now.</p>

<p>“But, if ectoplasm is something that contaminates your blood, your whole DNA, wouldn’t it be something a medical professional would see in test results? Considering that there’s papers about ecto-biology being published and – wait, have you not <em>visited</em> a doctor in the past <em>year</em>?” Cisco had been reading through some of the Fentons’ papers and had worked with a little of the Fenton tech. </p>

<p>Barry had been wondering the same thing. High schoolers get physical checkups and vaccinations before their freshman year, and athletes get regular checkups – if the kid wasn’t an athlete, maybe his powers came in – his accident happened – after his freshman year of high school started. </p>

<p>“I <em>have</em>,” Phantom gestured to Caitlyn. She raised a knowing eyebrow; she was suspiciously unsurprised at Danny’s news. </p>

<p>“Ohhh my godd,”  Cisco gasped. “When did she find out?”</p>

<p>“A couple weeks ago,” Caitlyn admitted. “When I helped Dr. Fenton with the ecto-virus incident in Amity Park,”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you found out before us! I can’t believe I was right!” </p>

<p>“Remember, you can’t tell people!” </p>

<p>“I remember!” </p>

<p>It was weird that Caitlyn found out <em>before</em> Dr. Fenton, when the two worked on the same case. Now that he knew Danny <em>Fenton</em> was a high school kid, it made sense why he only ever visited Central City on weekends. The kid probably had his own villains to deal with, and his own homework to catch up on, and he still made time to visit StarLabs. </p>

<p>He thought back to all the times Phantom had helped them, to all the times <em>Danny</em> had helped them, the times he helped them deal with meta-humans they couldn’t apprehend on their own, indulge in their physics experiments, and test the scale of each other’s powers. It was fun for them all, and mutually beneficial, but Barry couldn’t help but feel like Central City benefited more from Phantom than Amity Park benefited from the Flash. Maybe Flash could help Phantom out, maybe <em>Barry </em>could help <em>Danny</em> out, somehow. </p>

<p>“Anyway, now that you all know,” Phantom passed out slips of papers to everyone. “I need you all to memorize these secret passphrases,”</p>

<p>What? Where did those slips of paper come from? Did his ghost suit have pockets?</p>

<p>“And you can’t tell them to <em>anyone.</em>” </p>

<p>Barry’s paper read: </p>

<blockquote class=”scrap-paper”>
<p>Q: what is your favorite lady gaga song? <br />
A: bad romance </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not true!</p>

<p>“The only other person who knows what's written in there is me! Don’t share them with each other! They’re all different, so they’re extra secret! It’s a consp – contin – it’s a <em>backup</em> plan!” </p>

<p>“A backup plan for… what exactly?” Dr. Wells asked.  </p>

<p>“Okay so my friends and I do this thing where we have code phrases for a bunch of impossible scenarios in case they <em>aren’t</em> actually impossible. But the phrases can fit into regular conversations. So like, we each have different code phrases in case one of us is a double agent, another different code phrase in case we’re <em>triple</em> agents, a code phrase in case there’s an imposter pretending to be us, or in case we’re being held hostage on a phone call – things like that.”</p>

<p>“A <em>contingency </em>plan,” Cisco said.</p>

<p>“Yes, that!” </p>

<p>“Can I change my code phrase? This is a flat out lie.” </p>

<p>“The lie is the point! And you <em>can</em> change your code phrase, but only if you come up with a better one.” Phantom laughed. </p>

<p>“So,... what contingency are you planning for?”</p>

<p>“For now, it’s if you need my help but can’t make it obvious,” Danny said. “A ‘Get out of Jail’ free card from me. Like there’s a kidnapper eavesdropping on your phone-a-friend call, or maybe if someone else who doesn’t know that Barry is the Flash or that I’m Phantom is listening in on us but we can’t let them know – something like that. This is a city of metas, anything can happen!”” </p>

<p>The triple agent scenario seemed like fun make-believe role play, but a kidnapping scenario was less so. Barry had a similar code word arrangement with his foster father every time he had gone to a classmate’s house for sleepovers back in high school, so he knew from experience that it was applicable in reality. </p>

<p>“Then why do we all need different ones?” Caitlyn asked. “Since you don’t want us to share our code phrases,” </p>

<p>“Well, it was fun to come up with each one.” Phantom said. “It’s something special for me to share with each of you,”</p>

<hr />

<p>Wells wasn’t surprised by Danny’s secret – he was surprised by Danny’s choice to reveal it. He’d already seen such a transformation with Vlad, so he tried his best to appear naturally surprised, just like everyone else. While Wells would now lose the element of surprise, knowing something he shouldn’t, Phantom would naturally lower his guard in the upcoming weeks; he could <em>work </em>this to his advantage.</p>

<p>The code phrases… he could <em>technically </em>see the utility in them. For discrete yet open communication, Phantom had created a very simple handshake protocol or cipher, dressed up as a childish playground activity. Even if they ended up as nothing more than a bonding activity, it would be easy enough for Wells to find out everyone else’s code phrases, with a quick peek through the StarLabs camera. </p>

<p>Later. He had more pressing things to do, according to his timeline. </p>

<p>According to Gideon’s news archives, Phantom will publicly disappear four months from now. Fenton will also be declared missing about four months from now. Wells’s speedster powered time machine was almost complete. He was slightly ahead of schedule too, so he can afford to observe the ghost boy just a little longer. </p>

<p>After whatever event horizon passes that results in the longer term disappearance of the Fenton-Phantom boy, Wells can set his own plans into motion – plans that would set the timeline back on track, ensuring that he could return to a future where <em>he</em> would be the supreme Flash. </p>
