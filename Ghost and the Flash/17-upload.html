<p>Danny woke up chilly and in an uncomfortable position. Instead of lying down in bed with his blanket covering his body, he was sitting up on a chair. He tried to bring his hand up to rub his neck, which was stiff from drooping forward, but found it tied behind his back. He blinked his eyes and looked around; he was inside what looked like a warehouse with high windows, nondescript boxes stalked on and against generic shelves along the wall. There was a catwalk above him, its shadow darkening his view. There was the smell of pizza somewhere.</p>

<p>In front of him, two unfamiliar men were sitting in chairs and loudly arguing. </p>

<p>“So, what now?” The taller of the two men said.</p>

<p>“We’re supposed to call his parents for the ransom money, duh,” the shorter one responded.</p>

<p>So, Danny was kidnapped. </p>

<p>He had transformed back in a deserted part of town to bait the ecto-pi he was tracking, but baited the wrong type of attention instead. A bat had hit his head from behind and… then he woke up here.</p>

<p>“Do you know his parents’ number?” </p>

<p>“No,”</p>

<p>“Shit, it’s just Fentonworks, Google it!” </p>

<p>“You do it!” </p>

<p>Danny was usually an unassuming kid as Fenton. He wasn’t particularly rich, or smart, or famous – the thought of being worth any ransom money felt laughable. He’s always <em>wanted</em> to be seen – by his peers, his parents – but not like this. </p>

<p>“Fine, but If I google it, you talk to them on the phone,” </p>

<p>“What if his parents don’t pick up the phone?”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t they? No actually, I don't care why. Before you come up with a reason, just call,” </p>

<p>“Oh maybe I can use their son’s phone number! Hey kid, what’s your passcode?” </p>

<p>“Shit when did you wake up?!” </p>

<p>“Uh,” Danny answered. “Just now?” </p>

<p>“Are you hungry? We have pizza.” </p>

<p>Did they expect to keep Danny for a long time?</p>

<p>“Don’t offer the hostage pizza!” </p>

<p>They resumed bickering amongst themselves, but eventually handed Danny a slice on a paper plate.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’m starving,” Danny reached out and accepted the plate.</p>

<p>“Hey, weren’t his hands tied?” </p>

<p>“Not very well,” Danny said as he bit into the pizza. It was tied so sloppily that Danny could slip his hands out without even needing to phase. </p>

<p>“How are your knots <em>still </em>bad? We went over this!” </p>

<p>“My knots <em>are</em> good! The kid must be some regular Houdini I swear!” </p>

<p>“We’ll try again after he finishes eating the pizza,” the taller grunt said. </p>

<p>It was laughable that they assumed Danny would voluntarily stay or cooperate in being tied up again. The two grunts grabbed their own slices of pizza and joined him to eat. They were both wearing nondescript gray tracksuits, didn’t have any distinguishable physical features – aside from their height – and were both equally incompetent. </p>

<p>Danny could escape and be home in time for dinner, and no one would even know what happened. Except… he needed to find out why these guys kidnapped him. He should stay awhile, just to find out. It would be easy. </p>

<p>“Hey, what's your moms phone number?” Shorty asked Danny.</p>

<p>“Damn, only 30 years too late to get your crush’s phone number,” </p>

<p>“Hey, if Vomiting Vlad couldn’t get her and still be a billionaire, then we can too! Besides, his parents must be rolling in dough after that North Mercy Hospital shit went down,” </p>

<p>Danny rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>Danny’s friends already had a few potential addresses shortlisted, Barry decided to check each location in person while Cisco used the StarLabs supercomputer and satellite to track down any new information or sightings. At his speed, it took about ten minutes for him to run from Central City to Amity Park. That, and the time it would take him to search each address – a lot could happen, and Barry hoped he wasn’t too late. </p>

<p>The first abandoned warehouse, on the furthest outskirts he searched was the jackpot. Cisco flagged this address as the most likely kidnapping spot because of an unusual, out of the way pizza delivery made fifteen minutes ago. The moment Barry shoved the large doors of the warehouse open, he could see Danny sitting on a chair, hands behind his back and bound to it with rope. The two kidnappers hadn’t turned their back to see Flash yet, but Danny’s eyes perked up immediately. </p>

<p>Barry budgeted 50 seconds to sweep the entire warehouse twice, looking for any weaponry – there was a single handgun, a few crumpled pizza boxes, but luckily no bombs or machine guns.</p>

<p>Without dropping his speed, Barry circled around the kidnappers – they weren’t armed, so he delivered lightning gut punches to each one, before turning around to untie Danny. He spared a few seconds to use the unwound rope to tie the kidnappers to a pole, before carrying Danny a safe distance away outside. Barry stopped past the trees beside the road – the cover of foliage hiding the Flash from view, and giving him a chance to talk to Danny privately. </p>

<p>He sent Danny’s friends a quick dm that Danny was found safe, and to drop an anonymous tip – with the location of some tied up kidnappers – to the police on his behalf, before turning to Danny. He was glad the kid was safe, but something wasn’t right about the entire situation. </p>

<p>“Are you okay?” Barry put his arms on Danny’s shoulders. </p>

<p>“Yeah.” The boy tried looking past Barry’s shoulders. “Hey, what time is it?” </p>

<p>“It’s 9pm. Danny what happened?” </p>

<p>“I got kidnapped – it wasn’t that bad! It’s not like they were that competent or anything. They wanted ransom money from Fentonworks.” Danny looked around the road some more. “Luckily, we won’t need to pay any ransom.”</p>

<p>Barry pulled one of his hands off Danny’s shoulders, but his glare didn’t let up.</p>

<p>“So…” Danny gulped. “Thanks for the save, Flash. I guess I’ll just… fly back home now?”</p>

<p>“Like you could have flown back, hours ago?”  </p>

<p>Danny visibly winced. </p>

<p>How did a half ghost who can phase through almost anything get captured by D-grade kidnappers who couldn’t even tie the rope around him properly? Unless…</p>

<p>“Hey Danny. What’s my favorite song?” </p>

<p>“Your favorite… wait are you seriously–?” </p>

<p>“Just answer the question,” </p>

<p>Danny looked almost offended. Anyone who knew that The Flash was Barry Allen would know that his favorite song was Poker Face by Lady Gaga – it was listed on his public Facebook page. But that’s not what Danny was supposed to say.</p>

<p>“Bad Romance,...” Danny grumbled out. “Look, It really <em>is</em> me. I’m not hurt – as you could obviously tell – and now I gotta come up with a brand new code phrase, thanks a lot,” </p>

<p>Barry sighed. That wasn’t what he was worried about.</p>

<p>“If they didn’t hurt you…, they didn’t steal anything from you, did they? Did they have blackmail on you? Is that why you didn’t try to escape right away?” </p>

<p>“I didn’t wanna alert them about my powers, in case they were <em>actually</em> dangerous – I mean they weren’t, but I didn’t know about that at first.” </p>

<p>Barry found that hard to believe, given the amount of pizza boxes he saw littered in the warehouse. More than two people’s worth of junk food, and the kidnappers were most likely hiding in there for a very short time – if he considered Danny’s kidnapping to be when they hid there. </p>

<p>“How’d you find me, anyway?” Danny asked.</p>

<p>“Your friends texted that you went missing, and Cisco tracked this place down,” </p>

<p>Danny had been missing for three hours. His friends were expecting him at the Nasty Burger after catching some ghosts that had gotten too close to the edge of town, and when Danny didn’t respond, they messaged Barry first – they thought that Danny was missing because of Phantom business, so it <em>was</em> the safest choice. </p>

<p>“Of course,” A smile ghosted Danny’s face. “Maybe I’m being overdramatic, but... I kinda hoped <em>my parents</em> would notice, and that <em>they’d </em>be the ones to come and get me.” </p>

<p>Barry paused. Was the kidnapping an accident? Or an “accident”? </p>

<p>“...Danny, did you get yourself kidnapped on purpose for attention?”</p>

<p>“Whaaaaat? <em>No,</em> of cour–”</p>

<p>“Be honest.” </p>

<p>Danny gulped.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t on purpose, I promise! I kept my powers under wraps when I got jumped, so the kidnappers thought I was human, and… I guess I wanted to know how long it’d take for someone to notice I was missing.”</p>

<p>Danny wanted to know how long it would take before his <em>parents</em> noticed he was missing – but Danny’s friends went to pains to hide what happened today <em>from</em> his parents. Something wasn’t adding up. </p>

<p>“Your parents don’t know you’re Phantom,” Barry said. “So they don’t know how often you spend your time fighting ghosts, or, getting <em>hurt</em> from fighting ghosts.” But when Barry had visited Fentonworks that first time, months ago, Danny had been annoyed – not at his parents, but at Barry and Iris for taking his parents’ time away from him. </p>

<p>“You don’t get to spend a lot of time with your parents, do you? Because you’re Phantom, because of how <em>often</em> you’re Phantom.” </p>

<p>Something in Danny’s expression shifted. </p>

<p>The Fentons didn’t know about Danny’s identity as Phantom – Barry couldn’t imagine doing his bit as the Flash without Joe’s help to cover for him, or without StarLabs’ help. Danny was basically operating as a solo vigilante. The kid had already explained his logic for why he chose not to tell his parents… yet. </p>

<p>“Do you plan to tell them, ever? That you’re Phantom?” </p>

<p>“I want to, but what happens when I do?” Danny replied. </p>

<p>Danny turned around. Barry could see him rubbing his eyes with his hands. </p>

<p>“I hate lying to them, I hate hiding from them, but I kind of have to. Whenever I get hurt as Phantom, I usually deal with it myself. But I thought… if I got hurt when I wasn’t a ghost, or doing ghostly things, maybe, someone – my <em>parents</em> – would come and ask me ‘are you okay?’ or like, maybe they’d actually <em>look</em> at me, you know?” </p>

<p>Danny sighed, turning his head away. “Like, my friends helped a lot in the beginning, but they can’t heal or handle it the way I do. I’d never put them through what I go through just for an extra fighting hand, but… it’s lonely.”</p>

<p>He must feel like the weight of the world is on his shoulders, and in trying to hold it all up, he’s breaking himself, Barry thought.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to burden people with my problems, so I try to handle it all myself. I guess I’m doing a good job of making it look like I have it all together, because no one seems to notice that I’m struggling – or they just blame it all on the terrible American education system. When my problems appear so mid, no one takes it seriously, you know? So I thought I’d need something actually serious for people.” Danny sniffled. </p>

<p>It wouldn’t have gotten that bad if Danny had just asked for help, properly – but who would he have asked? His friends, who know about his condition but are also teenagers and probably also have to deal with homework and parents and curfew? Or his parents – a wild card with seemingly unpredictable consequences to the revelation of Danny’s powers? </p>

<p>Barry sighed. The more he thought about it, the stupider Danny was for keeping his powers a secret from his parents for this long – but he wasn’t here to criticize Danny’s choices, he was just going to listen. It’s not like he could change the past, so he might as well focus on improving the present. After all, Barry was a kid, once upon a time, who also made his fair share of stupid decisions.</p>

<p>“It’s just… I <em>do</em> want my parents to notice me, but also I don’t, because then that’d blow my cover as Phantom. I want it both ways, for them to know about me <em>and</em> for me to be free as Phantom, to fly out and keep this city safe. But it feels like I <em>can’t</em> have it both ways.” </p>

<p>Danny turned to face Barry. </p>

<p>“<em>You</em> have it both ways, where people know you’re the Flash and they cover for you and help you and – and I want that!” Danny’s voice dropped down to a whisper. “But I’m scared. I’m scared that by telling them, I’ll make it worse.”</p>

<p>After finding out Danny’s half-ghost status, Barry theorized that Danny’s lab accident most likely happened in his own basement; he wondered how much of Danny’s lack of self-preservation skills was a deep rooted need for attention – attention from the town, attention from his peers, attention from his parents – among the other needs and pressures of growing up. </p>

<p>It reminded Barry of his first few months in the foster system – he’d run away from home about once a week to try and visit his <em>real dad</em> in jail, or to the police station to tell them they’d made a mistake and arrested the wrong person. That need for attention, the odd coping mechanisms, even the somewhat contradictory logic... Barry understood it. He’d almost forgotten it. He felt like Danny was a younger version of himself. Barry wished he had siblings growing up – then his upside down world would have felt less lonely. Maybe Barry could help Danny feel less lonely, in a way he wished someone did for him at the same age. </p>

<p>“But they <em>know</em> Phantom’s not all that bad, right?” Barry asked. “Caitlyn told me how Phantom worked together with the Fentons to help cure the virus that was going around Amity Park,” </p>

<p>“But, that’s not the same, I think.” Danny said. “Knowing Phantom is not all that bad is not the same as accepting that Phantom was me the entire time. Or that I’m part ghost. I used to be afraid that the moment they find out who and what I am, they’d either disown me or dissect me. That it couldn’t get any worse than that. But after working together with them that one time, I think it <em>can</em> get worse. I think it’d kill them to know that the every effort they put towards hurting or capturing or bad mouthing the ghost boy was aimed at <em>me</em> – that they were hurting their own son without realizing it.” </p>

<p>Assuming they don’t go the disowning or dissection route, that is.</p>

<p>Barry took that thought in. If Danny was ‘hurt’ by something that was neither his parents, nor another ghost… he could begin to see a twisted sense of logic in Danny’s actions, after thinking himself into circles. But that didn’t mean he agreed with Danny’s actions, either. As the older meta-human with powers, it would be up to Barry to help Danny out.</p>

<p>“Danny, I still think you should try and tell your parents your secret, while you still have the chance. Before someone takes that chance away from you.”</p>

<p>“Chance?”</p>

<p>“It’ll hurt your parents more if they find out something that important about you from someone else,” Barry explained. “And, if you talk to your parents about what happened to you first, <em>you</em> control the narrative. No one can tell your parents untrue things about who and what you are.” </p>

<p>There was a silence, as Danny took in the words. </p>

<p>“Do they have to know?” Danny finally said.</p>

<p>Barry didn’t like where this was going. </p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean, what if I– “ Danny sighed. “Okay, I know you’re not gonna like this, but hear me out. What if I lived as Phantom full time, and faked Fenton’s death. Then–” </p>

<p>“What the hell?!” Barry interrupted. “Uh-uh, no way,” </p>

<p>I <em>know</em> it sounds bad, but, it’s one way that my parents' image of me – of human me, of <em>Fenton</em> me – won't be tainted by any of their biases!” </p>

<p>This was obviously a bad idea, one that Danny might take seriously –  Barry had to nip it in the bud.</p>

<p>“And then what about school?” Barry asked. “College? Living expenses?” </p>

<p>“I… I could take a GED?” Danny offered weakly. </p>

<p>“What about your sister? Your friends? Would you trade an easier life for never seeing your friends again?” </p>

<p>“I can still –” </p>

<p>“No you can’t, Danny. It would expose your plan to your parents, and then, in their grief, your parents might blame Phantom for Fenton’s “death”, and then your plan would have been meaningless,” Barry said. “And, if after all that, they do learn that Fenton and Phantom were one and the same, they might treat you as a full ghost instead of a half ghost. You wouldn’t confront their prejudices, you’d just be running away without trying to talk to them, and I think that’d hurt your parents more than you think.” </p>

<p>Danny sat in silence for a while.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that was a pretty stupid plan anyway,” he said quietly. </p>

<p>Barry breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“It’s one thing to distance yourself from people who don’t accept you for who and what you are. It’s another to run away without even trying.”</p>

<p>“But I still don’t know <em>how</em> I’m gonna tell them.” Danny sniffled. </p>

<p>“We can figure that out, maybe not now, or not soon. Whenever you’re ready. But when you do, we’ll be there for you,” </p>

<p>There was the sound of police sirens in the distance. </p>

<p>“And hey, if things go south, you can take up Cisco’s offer on that adoption,” </p>

<p>“That wasn’t a <em>serious</em> offer,” Danny responded with a wet laugh.  </p>

<p>“Then one of us will! The age gap between us is too small to pretend we’re father and son, but I think you and I could pass as brothers,” </p>

<p>Danny laughed while wiping tears. </p>

<p>Barry put his hand back on Danny’s shoulder, this time without the aggressive panic from before. “Are you okay? Really?”</p>

<p>Danny glanced away, and took a deep breath before meeting Barry’s gaze. </p>

<p>“I will be,” </p>

<p>That might be as good an answer as Barry could hope to get at the moment. They needed to leave before the police arrived and questioned their presence. </p>

<p>“Alright, let me at least drop you off home,” Before Danny could argue further, Barry said. “Don’t tell me you can get home faster by yourself because we both know that’s not true,”</p>

<p>“Alright, alright, fine,” </p>

<p>Barry stood behind Danny, keeping one hand behind Danny’s neck and the other on Danny’s back, before tapping into his super speed and starting the run back to Fentonworks. He didn’t use his top speed, because he needed to concentrate holding Danny upright and navigate the roads, but it took him about a minute to reach the outskirts of the cul-de-sac Danny lived at. Danny gagged and looked ready to vomit when Barry had stopped their run, but straightened his back after a few coughs, before turning to Barry. </p>

<p>“Thanks,” Danny said. “It’d look too suspicious if I appeared right outside my door,” </p>

<p>“No problem,” Barry said. “And hey – before I go – give me your phone,” </p>

<p>“Huh? Why?” </p>

<p>“Lemme add my phone number.” Barry watched Danny fish out the phone from his pocket and pressed the home button, before handing it to him.</p>

<p>Barry tapped in his phone number and saved it to Danny’s contacts.</p>

<p>“Call or text me if you ever need anything. Seriously. It might be easier than communicating through Twitter dms,” Barry chuckled. “Also, why do you not have a pin code on your phone?”</p>

<p>“It’s kinda easier to get into my phone while flying if I don’t have to enter a password,” Danny replied sheepishly. “I can’t reach my fingerprint while I’m Ph– while flying, and I wasn’t gonna use facial recognition as a lock, so I just decided to leave it unlocked. It’s not like anyone else ever uses my phone, and no one at school confiscates phones anymore,” </p>

<p>“Seriously? No tweeting while flying!”</p>

<p>“Then no texting while running.”</p>

<p>“You know that’s not the same,” Barry sighed with a slight laugh. “Anyway, I gotta get back,” It was late enough that no one was out – because of the possibility of ghost attacks – and he didn’t want to get spotted as the Flash in Amity Park either. “Text me when you reach home,” </p>

<p>“It’s literally a five minute walk away from here,” Danny replied.</p>

<p>“You still have to text me because we both know that I can reach my house before you can reach yours,” </p>

<p>“Fiiiiine,” </p>
