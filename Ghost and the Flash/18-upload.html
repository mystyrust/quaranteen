 <p>Danny started stuffing his backpack with all his wrinkled worksheets – which only became <em>more</em> wrinkled after he stuffed in his laptop, a charger, and a couple other books. The straps barely fit around his arms, but he was ready to go. He was just about to transform and fly off to the library when there was a knock on the door to his room. </p>
 
 <p>“Hey Danny, it’s almost dinner time!”</p>
 
 <p>For once, Danny had a perfectly legitimate reason to skip dinner and get out of his house.</p>
 
 <p>“Actually, I was gonna go the library to study and get some tutoring,” </p>
 
 <p>Jazz opened the door. </p>
 
 <p>“Oh, are you sure? I could help you!” </p>
 
 <p>But Barry was already on his way, Danny didn’t want the speedster to cancel his trip.</p>
 
 <p>“Don’t worry about it Jazz, the tutoring is free,”</p>
 
 <p>“O-Oh,” </p>
 
 <p>Jazz should feel happy that he’s willingly trying to study for once, but he still feels like he let his sister down somehow. Did she think he was making an excuse to escape a family dinner? </p>
 
 <p>“Um, maybe you could drop me off at the library? I still need a ride,” Danny said. He couldn’t fly out to the library now that he’d been spotted, and maybe driving would make his completely real reasons appear legitimate. </p>
 
 <p>“Of course I can. Let me just grab my keys and jacket,” </p>

        <span class="hide"><b>Barry:</b></span> <span class="text">toooo slow im already here</span><br/>
    </p>
 </div>
 
 <p>It was half way through the drive that the realization slammed into Danny like a bad car brake – Jazz wanted him to ask <em>her</em> for help. Homework was something that she was good at, but,... she’d turn every third sentence into a psychoanalysis, and she wasn’t great at explaining some of the harder concepts that flew right over his head, because she tried to cover as many topics as possible in a short amount of time. Maybe when he was more caught up with his school work, he’d give Jazz’s tutoring another try.</p>
 
 <p>Once they arrived at the library, Danny ran inside, and had no trouble finding the study room that Barry was occupying. There were four boxes of pizza and two liters of soda inside. There wasn’t anybody in the library at this hour, except maybe a lone librarian, which must be how Barry was able to sneak in that much food and without being scolded for it</p>
 
 <p>Being tutored by someone who was both an expert in the subject matter and knew that Danny was Phantom was a trippy experience. Since Barry had shared many adventures with Phantom, he pulled examples from real life to explain an abstract concept if Danny couldn’t understand the textbook explanations. </p>
 
 <p>“I’m always confused between centripetal force and centrifugal force. One of them pulls you and one of them pushes?”</p>
 
 <p>They’d started on physics. </p>
 
 <p>“Remember that time when I ran around in circles at superspeed and created a mini tornado in Amity Park?”</p>
 
 <p>There’s no way Danny would forget <em>that</em>.</p>
 
 <p>“That was centripetal force pulling you in the circular path of the tornado.”</p>
 
 <p>“Then what about centrifugal force?” </p>
 
 <p>Danny had experienced the sensation of one, but not that other, and that made the concept easy to remember.</p>
 
 <p>“That’s a little complicated, but centrifugal force is when the circular speed is lost, and you’re forced outwards. Remember the first time you tried running laps in the Particle Accelerator chamber, and you couldn’t stop and you flung yourself outward?” Barry asked. </p>
 
 <p>“...Yes?”</p>
 
 <p>“That was the centri<em>fugal</em> force, <em>forcing </em>you, outward,”</p>
 
 <p>Nevermind, Danny was back to square one. </p>
 
 <p>“That’s… confusing,” Danny had chosen to start being tutored in physics first because it was math but harder – and also Barry was a physics major in college. Danny was ‘just fine’ at math, but the introduction of real world logic with numbers that weren’t price tags and sales made his head spin. </p>
 
 <p>“Okay, maybe that was a bad example, because you were the one running. But in the tornado example, you weren’t running, you were being affected by someone else’s force,” </p>
 
 <p>Danny was getting confused between explanations where the object on which force was applied was moving, and when it was stationary – he’d have to ask Barry to explain that again to him later. He finished a few worksheets and he was starving; Barry had already eaten through one and a half pizza by himself. </p>
 
 <p>“How come you eat so much?” Danny finally asked. </p>
 
 <p>“Well, ever since I got my powers, my calorie intake has been insanely high. I need to eat in order to run, and I run a lot more than the usual human.” Barry reached for another slice. “What about you? I wouldn’t be surprised if you’d need to eat more than most, too,” </p>
 
 <p>Danny was always scrawny and struggled to build muscle even before his lab accident.</p>
 
 <p>“I dunno, I haven’t felt any more or less hungrier than usual after my lab accident,” Danny responded. “It definitely wouldn’t hurt for me to eat a little more though,” </p>
 
 <p>Danny reached for a slice, and Barry paused his chewing, as if deep in thought. Maybe Danny shouldn’t have mentioned his accident. Sure, he joked about it with Sam and Tucker sometimes, but he didn’t need – nor want – any pitying eyes from an adult figure; especially not one that he looked up to. The mood was tense, the silence only broken by the sound of chewing on pizza. </p>
 
 <p>Danny reached for another slice when Barry finally spoke up.</p>
 
 <p>“After my lab accident I was in a coma for nine months,” Barry said. “Cisco and I joked about how my coma was the same length as a pregnancy, like I was pregnant with speedpowers or something,” </p>
 
 <p>Danny choked down his laughter. He stole a glance at Barry, who was also chuckling. Barry wasn’t offended, and he was <em>inviting </em>Danny to joke about it. Danny felt himself relax a little. </p>
 
 <p>“Sam and I joked that my accident tried to reboot me in dark mode, since my suit is a palette swap of whatever I wore when I had my accident.” Danny said. “That made it funnier when no one was able to recognize me,” </p>
 
 <p>“Wait, your suit is–? You didn’t make your suit?” </p>
 
 <p>“No? It was an old hazmat suit,” Danny said. “Wait, you made your suit? You’re saying you<em> chose </em>to look like Lightning McQueen?”</p>
 
 <p>“That’s Cisco’s fault! I was too busy being <em>comatose</em> to give Cisco any feedback on the suit design!” </p>
 
 <p>“Oh sure, blame the one guy who <em>isn’t</em> here to defend himself,” </p>
 
 <p>A part of Danny wished he also had a coma right after his accident, if only to catch up on sleep and have someone look after him the entire time. It sounded nice – even though it probably wasn’t nice for Barry or whoever was taking care of him while he slept. Danny would have probably slept like the dead, and that would have freaked out whoever might’ve watched over him. </p>
 
 <p>Barry’s laugh eased the tension that Danny was feeling. </p>
 <p>“I also got a Lichtenberg scar,” Danny added. “It only shows up in ghost form, but my clothes mostly hide it,” Barry remembered seeing it a few times on Danny’s hand at StarLabs – it glowed when Phantom’s glove was removed. </p>
 
 <p>“Oh, I have one too,” Barry responded. </p>
 
 <p>“Since when?” </p>
 
 <p>“Since my lab accident? Mine was also an electrocution –  though there was some concoction of chemicals that fell on me too,”</p>
 
 <p>“We have the same type of scar?” Danny put his slice down. “Does yours glow too?”  </p>
 
 <p>“No – does yours? That’s weird,” </p>
 
 <p>“You can run at speeds faster than most people can even think, and you draw the line at a glowing scar? <em>Bruh,</em>” </p>
 
 <p>“Scars are fragments of newly healed skin, and skin doesn’t <em>glow</em> at any –”</p>
 
 <p>“You have glowy lightning.” Danny pointed out. “ And we have matching scars! We’re scarbros!” </p>
 
 <p>They laughed – maybe a little too loudly. They had booked a private study room at the library to talk and study and eat privately, but that didn’t stop a librarian from slapping their door handle and hissing a “Keep it down!” at them. </p>
 
 <p>Danny went back to his homework fairly quickly, trying to do as much as he can by himself – he needs to know how to do it for the CAT exam, after all. His confidence grew as he managed to answer several questions correctly after Barry checked over his work. While he continued his homework, Barry pulled out a laptop to do some of his own. Danny didn’t ask, but he didn’t have to wait long to find out what Barry was working on. </p>
 
 <p>“Hey Danny,” Barry flipped the laptop around so that Danny could see. “What do you think of these?” </p>
 
 <p>Danny knew what blueprints looked like – he’d seen quite a few of them around the house when his parents were building the portal and other inventions, ecto-powered or otherwise. There was the StarLabs logo in the corner, some math and science jargon that he couldn’t understand, but the overall shape of it was clear. </p>
 
 <p>“It looks like a giant hamster wheel,” Danny said. “Like human sized. Is it for you to train your speed with or something?” </p>
 
 <p>“Something like that,” Barry answered quietly. “This machine is designed to withstand the speed and friction of the speedster like the Flash,” </p>
 
 <p>“Don’t you already have that super treadmill for speed training? The one that Cisco built? And you can run inside the accelerator too.” Building a hamster wheel speed training machine felt unnecessary. </p>
 
 <p>“I dunno,” Barry said. “I just noticed that a couple of the parts match the equipment that the Yellow Flash stole from labs around Central City. I thought <em>that</em> was weird.”</p>
 
 <p>“Oh, do you think the Yellow Flash is onto you guys? He’s stealing those parts so that you can’t build this machine and become faster than him or something?” Danny thought.</p>
 
 <p>“But the blueprints are almost a year old,” Barry pointed out. “From after the particle accelerator explosion, sure, but how would Yellow Flash even know about these?” </p>
 
 <p>Danny looked at the date. “Wasn’t this from the time you were in a coma? You <em>did</em> say it was for 9 months…”</p>
 
 <p>“Huh, yeah,...” </p>
 
 <p>“Maybe your Flash powers were showing themselves during your coma, and that’s why this machine was designed” Danny said.</p>
 
 <p>It felt like Barry was trying to solve a puzzle that Danny was missing a few pieces to. Something wasn’t adding up about Dr. Wells’s blueprints, but maybe that’s just because of how smart the guy is. </p>
 
 <p>“Why don’t you ask Dr. Wells about it?” Danny added.</p>
 
 <p>“Um. He doesn’t know that I have these blueprints,” Barry admitted. “It came from the USB that Hartley stole from his home, and I… forgot to give it back to him.” Danny gasped.</p>
 
 <p>“And to think you gave <em>me</em> crap about not telling my parents about my powers,” Danny said. “You’re no better than me,” </p>
 
 <p>“Hey, do as I say, not as I do!” Barry responded. “I still think you should tell your parents.” Barry flipped the laptop back to face him. Danny took that as the signal to resume his homework.</p>
 
 <p>“If it makes you feel any better,” Barry added, “I recently told Eddie about my powers,”</p>
 
 <p>Eddie was Barry’s coworker whom he hated because that guy was dating Barry’s crush, Iris, Danny remembered. </p>
 
 <p>“How did that go?” </p>
 
 <p>“He asked me for an autograph,” </p>
 
 <p>Danny chuckled. Maybe that’s what he should do – practice telling someone else, <em>before</em> telling his parents. Someone he could trust to not babble his secret – and he knew just who he wanted to tell. </p>
 
 <hr />
 
 <p>“Okay ghost boy, are you gonna tell me why you want to meet near Elmerton after school on a rooftop?” </p>
 
 <p>After Phantom followed her home and figured out who she was under her suit, Valerie made it a point to never talk to the ghost boy in public without it. But then she noticed him “checking up” on her during her shift at Target, and then ran into him at Central City during her winter break, and then found him running around North Mercy hospital… yeah she’d been bumping into him a lot outside of ghost hunting, lately. </p>
 
 <p>Phantom took in a deep breath, floating down to the rooftop. His feet touched down on the tile, and he appeared more solid. If Phantom had asked her to meet in a hidden alleyway, she’d have declined. At least meeting on a rooftop gave her the option to fly away, while still keeping their conversation private. </p>
 
 <p>“Okay, so.” Phantom started pacing around. “Um. Okay, this is hard to explain, so let me ask. What do you think of me?” </p>
 
 <p>Was he fishing for a compliment? Well, if that’s what it would take for him to get back on topic…</p>
 
 <p>“I used to think you were a menace for inviting all the ghosts over here. That you didn’t care about people and the damage you left behind,” Phantom winced at that, but Valerie continued. “But now I know that you do care about people and their lives. Maybe too much, maybe more than living people care about other people. Other ghosts don’t seem to care about humans as much as you do either.” </p>
 
 <p>Phantom spluttered, a green tint covering his skin. It disappeared as he coughed into his hands. </p>
 
 <p>“Okay, okay,” Phantom cleared his throat. “I meant, about <em>what</em> I am, not <em>who</em> I am, but I am glad you can see me for my personality. What do you think I <em>am</em>?” </p>
 
 <p>“A ghost,” Valerie answered matter of factly. Phantom didn’t seem satisfied by that answer though.</p>
 
 <p>“But you just said I’m not like the other ghosts, right? Why do you think that is?”</p>
 
 <p>Valerie felt like there was a correct answer that she was missing, that Phantom was trying to lead her to. </p>
 
 <p>“You’re a ghost who cares,” Valerie added. </p>
 
 <p>It’s true, Phantom did care about her – her injury! He cared enough to check on her injury! But he did more than just care; he also understood the concept of trust, which she didn’t know a ghost was even capable of doing. There was a lot that she didn’t know about ghosts, but it seemed like she was learning about them in every moment she spent with Phantom – just like whatever she was about to learn now. </p>
 
 <p>“Why do you think I care about humans more than the other ghosts do?”</p>
 
 <p>Ghosts came in all sorts of shapes and sizes. If it weren’t for the glow and the floating, Phantom would have looked like some goofy cosplayer – like a human. Maybe because –</p>
 
 <p>“You were human once, weren’t you? You lived in Amity Park before?”</p>
 
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 
 <p>It was a no brainer – Valerie had gone down several reddit conspiracy theories trying to figure out what Phantom was, and where he came from. She’d already tried and failed to find out who he was before he died, by searching the records of recent and historical teenage deaths in Amity Park. When she couldn’t find any good candidates for Phantom’s name as a living human, she wondered if a deliberate cover up was responsible for hiding his cause of death, and if she were better off not knowing.</p>
 
 <p>But what would knowing his name change? Would he want her to contact his living family? Valerie was <em>not</em> the best person for this; she wasn’t good with her words, and she sometimes jumped to conclusions. The Fentons were the ghost experts, Phantom should go to them! Or, maybe to Jazz or Danny, if he felt like the adult scientists were still unapproachable. </p>
 
 <p>It was nice to see Phantom so happy that she was right about <em>something</em>, though. His smile was infectious, and Valerie found herself smiling too. But why had Phantom wanted her to spell out the obvious? There must be something more. </p>
 
 <p>“Valerie, what I’m about to confess to you is so serious,” Phantom walked up to her and held both her hands in his. Phantom <em>never</em> addressed her by name before, or <em>walked</em> when he could just float around. </p>
 
 <p>“Like, earth shatteringly serious.” He brought both their hands up to chest level, and stared at Valerie straight in the eyes. “Promise me you won’t tell anyone,”</p>
 
 <p>An earth shatteringly serious confession? Maybe if Phantom wasn’t a trouble maker, and wasn’t a ghost, they could’ve been… something more. </p>
 
 <p>She stared at his face; there were those green eyes again, shining bright in the dark. Traffic light green – something she always searched for in the dark, a welcome sight in the heavy traffic jam that was her life. At some point, she stopped hating the sight of him.</p>
 
 <p>Oh no, was she blushing? Sure it was past sunset, but Phantom’s glow made it feel warm and light. And, up close like this? It was almost romantic. </p>
 
 <p>Was he going to <em>–</em>? No. </p>
 
 <p>“Before you say anything, I’m going to say no,” Valerie said. </p>
 
 <p>She didn’t have time for a complicated interspecies romance. She didn’t have time for <em>any</em> romance, period. She had a crush on a guy from school already, and she couldn’t be with him before because she was a popular A-lister and he… wasn’t. And she can’t be with him <em>now</em> because she can’t possibly endanger him with all her ghost hunting activity. </p>
 
 <p>“No, what?” </p>
 
 <p>“No to your confession? I mean, I’m flattered, but –” </p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She could see the moment the words registered in his brain; his eyebrows arched up, his skin tinted green – oh that was him <em>blushing. </em></p>
 
 <p>“You <em>weren’t</em> trying to ask me out?” Valerie gulped. “Like on a date?” </p>
 
 <p>“I was confessing a secret, not a cru–” Phantom covered his face in embarrassment.</p>
 
 <p>Valerie realized she messed up. <em>Stupid stupid stupid Phantom was probably gonna say something about <strong>himself</strong> from when he was <strong>alive</strong></em> or something, <em>and I messed it up and made it awkward for the both of us and –</em></p>
 
 <p>“Oh my god,” Phantom let go of one hand, covering his face. “I see how you might think, I mean I do ha– that’s not the point, that’s not what I wanted to tell you, I was trying to– you know what, let me just–”</p>
 
 <p>A flash of bright light forced her to close her eyes. When she blinked her eyes open, Phantom was gone, and someone else stood in his place. </p>
 
 <p>Danny Fenton. He was holding her hands, the same ones Phantom had. She stared into his eyes, and they weren’t green anymore – they were blue. </p>
 
 <p>“It’s not that I <em>used</em> to be alive, I’m <em>still</em> alive,” she heard him say. His voice was – it was <em>similar</em> but it was missing a tinny quality in it. No wonder she– </p>
 
 <p>This was how Phantom stayed hidden in Amity Park. Everyone was looking for someone dead, not someone living. No one would think Fenton and Phantom were the same person – they have the same first names and rhyming last names; he was hiding in plain sight. He was telling her his biggest secret, and she thought he was asking her out on a date – all because she had gotten a slight crush on him at some point. Twice. Valerie was beyond mortified.</p>
 
 <p>At some point he let go of her hands. She slapped his face.</p>
 
 <p>“Oww!! What was that for?!”</p>
 
 <p>“Just checking if this was a dream.” There, now he would forget how embarrassing her assumption was. </p>
 
 <p>“You’re supposed to pinch yourself if you think it’s a dream, not slap someone else!” </p>
 
 <p>“My helmet was in the way!” Valerie took a deep breath, and removed her helmet. “Why’d you tell me?”</p>
 
 <p>“I… I wanted practice before telling my parents,” Danny responded. “This isn’t something anyone’s ever really prepared to learn, so I wanted to figure out how to do it right.”  </p>
 
 <p>Holy shit, he told her before he told his parents. Holy shit his parents were the Fentons.</p>
 
 <p>“I figure everyone has different reactions to being told something so earth shattering.” And then, with a slight laugh, Danny said, “I don’t think my parents would assume I was asking them out on a date though,”</p>
 
 <p>Valerie buried her face in her hands in embarrassment. </p>
 
 <p>“I…um… so,” Danny’s face had a red blush where Phantom had green. “About that date... is that a no?” </p>

 <p>Danny <em>had</em> thought about asking Valerie out before, but he never thought she'd say <em>yes</em>. And sure, their date started out because of a hilarious misunderstanding, but Danny seized the chance, and Valerie didn't say no – the study date was her idea. He wanted to do a more traditional date – flowers, chocolate, a movie! – instead of a study date. Unfortunately, they were both so behind on their current homework that a study date made the most sense; it would be the best way to spend some quality time by tackling their shared struggles together at the library. They have spent a lot of time together as Phantom and the Red Huntress – but that didn’t count. </p>
 
 <p>At the library, they chatted a little bit about the homework and classes that they had, which classes they were struggling with, and which homework they could work on together. Both Valerie and Danny were behind in History, but Valerie was further along her backlog than Danny was, so she ended up picking a different subject to catch up on. </p>
 
 <p>They kept the conversations short – never steering outside the boundaries of “Fenton” and “Gray”. It seemed awkward to talk about school when they both fought the same ghosts – and sometimes, each other. He wanted to tell her to stay away from Vlad, to stop going to him for weapons or upgrades, but he knows Valerie wouldn’t appreciate it – because if the situations were reversed, he might’ve made the same choices that she did. </p>
 
 <p>Maybe he should create a code phrase with Valerie too, like he did with the rest of Star Labs. It could come in handy – Barry already used his, and Danny had just finished coming up with another one for him. But, maybe it was too <em>soon</em>, he didn’t want to scare Valerie.</p>
 
 <p>Danny was afraid to bring up or talk about his ghost status – for fear of being seen as gross or exotic. Not that they’d be overheard or anything if they did talk about it – he had booked a quiet study room, so there wasn’t a risk of any sensitive conversation being overheard by anyone else in the library.  But he wanted to be liked for who he was, and didn’t want to show off to or scare Valerie away because of his powers. </p>
 
 <p>He didn’t want to spend the entire study date bothering her for help, when he couldn't help her back, so he was heads down in his homework. But the longer Danny stared at the words in his textbook, the less sense they made to him, and he gave up. He stared at his homework in a daze, when he felt his phone buzz in his pocket.</p>

 <p>“You’re Joe’s niece?!” </p>
 
 <p>Valerie looked up from her homework, confused.</p>
 
 <p>“I’ve worked with him in Central City,” Danny clarified, but immediately felt like he shouldn't have.</p>
 
 <p>“How do you know he’s my<em> </em>uncle?” She asked. “<em>I</em> didn’t even know he was my uncle until winter break,” </p>
 
 <p>“Uh…” Danny gulped. He might have messed up. “The Flash told me.” Shit. Danny could see some gears shift in her head, and then –</p>
 
 <p>“That Barry guy is The Flash, isn’t he?” </p>
 
 <p>Danny didn’t say anything for a few seconds too long, looking like a deer caught in headlights, and that gave Valerie all the information she needed.</p>
 
 <p>“Oh it <em>is</em> him, isn’t it? If it wasn’t him, my next guess would have been Iris’s boyfriend Eddie,” Valerie chuckled. </p>
 
 <p>Danny was usually careful about keeping the information that Fenton and Phantom know separate, but he forgot this time – and Valerie <em>is</em> smart. </p>
 
 <p>“Please don’t tell anyone!” Danny said. “It kind of is supposed to be a secret,” </p>
 
 <p>“Hey, I know how to keep a secret,” Valerie responded. “But can I ask you some questions about your –” she took a deep breath “– your powers?” </p>
 
 <p>“Sure,” Danny gulped. He instantly regretted it, because he could see so many ways this conversation could go wrong, and no ways it could go right.</p>
 
 <p>“Okay, so… since you can go invisible and intangible and stuff – do you ever watch movies for free at a movie theater?” </p>
 
 <p>“I…” Danny paused. “No, I’ve never – I mean I <em>could</em>, technically, but I’ve never done it. No time to do it,” Would it be considered theft if he did that? </p>
 
 <p>“What about swiping a snack from the vending machine using your powers?” </p>
 
 <p>“No, I don’t do that,” That <em>would</em> be considered theft. “I mean, I <em>can</em>, but I don’t. Too many eyes and cameras and like, those snacks technically cost money, so I shouldn’t,”</p>
 
 <p>“Then what <em>do</em> you use your powers for? When you’re not fighting ghosts, I mean.” Valerie asked. </p>
 
 <p>“I can dry my hair <em>instantly</em> after showering.” Danny said proudly. “And I can pull stuff from the fridge without opening the door. I mean, I <em>don’t</em> usually, because I don’t want my parents or sister to find out that I <em>can</em>, but I do it sometimes when they aren't around.”</p>
 
 <p>“Oh, drying hair that fast would be <em>so</em> useful,” Valerie said. Danny’s hair was straight and short, but Valerie’s hair was in voluminous curls that framed her face <em>perfectly</em>, almost in a crown. It must take a lot of time for her to style it and let it dry, for it to look that good; Danny coughed to cover his blush, hoping she didn’t see it.  </p>
 
 <p>“Isn’t there any way you can use your ghost powers to finish your homework faster?” Valerie quirked her brow.</p>
 
 <p>“In what way?” Danny asked. If he had speed powers like Barry, he could finish hours worth of homework in minutes, and still have time for hanging out with his friends and playing video games. His ghost powers don’t help with speed in any way. </p>
 
 <p>“Like, maybe take a peek at answer keys or something,” </p>
 
 <p>“I’ve tried,” Danny admitted; he wasn’t proud of it. “Sometimes they keep their answer keys in places I can’t find or get to, like in their computers. And sometimes, answer keys don’t exist, like for group projects and essays,” </p>
 
 <p>“Maybe it’s for the best,” Valerie sighed. “A huge improvement in your grades could be suspicious, your grades need to improve believably,”</p>
 
 <p>They go back to doing homework in silence, sneaking glances when they think the other isn’t looking.  </p>
 
 <p>“Oh hey wait!” Valerie perked up when a new idea crossed her mind, “Can you make duplicates of yourself? Like, those ectopi or that Plasmius ghost sometimes do?” She stared at all the folders and papers laid out on the table. “Couldn’t you make duplicates of yourself and give one essay or project or whatever to each clone, so that you can finish everything that much faster?”</p>
 
 <p>“Oh like Hermione’s Time Turner stuff!” Danny responded. “My duplicates are nowhere near good enough to do that yet, but I’ve thought about that before. Like, maybe as training.”  </p>
 
 <p>“Or, what if –” Valerie paused, then covered her mouth. “Hm, nevermind, it’s stupid,” </p>
 
 <p>“Wait no, tell me!” Danny responded. “What is it?” </p>
 
 <p>“It’s just… is it possible to visit ghosts of… <em>other</em> people? You know, people who’ve died 50 or 100 years ago? To interview them for like, a history project or something,” </p>
 
 <p><em>That</em> was something Danny hadn’t thought about before. </p>
 
 <p>“I dunno,” Danny answered honestly, deeply in thought. “But why would you think that’s stupid?”</p>
 
 <p>“Because every ghost I’ve ever seen – animal or human – has always attacked town. Who’s to say a ghost would be nice enough to let you interview them?”</p>
 
 <p>“Well, the nicer ghosts don’t usually come out of the ghost zone,” Danny answered. Once he made friends with Sidney Pointdexter, who used to be a student at Casper High about 50 years ago, Danny was introduced to some other friendly ghosts in the zone.Sidney <em>wanted</em> to come out of the ghost zone more often, but kept away because of Amity Park’s unwelcoming stance. Thought that didn’t stop other ghosts like Johnny 13 and Kitty from playing pranks or causing damage occasionally.</p>
 
 <p>He’s not sure what he could possibly interview Sidney about – nothing exciting happened in Amity Park in the past 100 or so years. But if Sidney exists, why wouldn’t other ghosts from other time periods <em>also</em> exist? Danny felt stupid for never considering that before. </p>
 
 <p>“I’m sure I could still go into the zone and find some<em> </em>nicer<em> </em>ghosts that’d be willing to give an interview or something,” Danny added. </p>
 
 <p>“But we don’t like it when ghosts come to our home. Do you think ghosts would be as welcoming of us into their turf? Or, what if it's just you and no one else?” </p>
 
 <p>It <em>was</em> a good question. Some ghosts saw him as one of them, some didn’t. </p>
 
 <p>“I don’t know,” Danny admitted. “But I think I can find out,” </p>
 
 <p>That wasn’t a terrible conversation about his ghost powers, Danny thought. Valerie wasn’t disgusted by his ghostly nature (or at least she wasn’t showing it), and she didn’t ask for any demonstrations of his powers, so Danny counted it as a win. She didn’t pity him either, like his friends or Barry did, she saw him as <em>him</em>, so it was… nice.</p>
 
 <p>“Okay, let’s say I <em>do</em> find a ghost who used to be a famous living human who won’t attack me on sight – like, I dunno, maybe the ghost of George Washington or something. And I get an interview from him, and he tells me something that no one can prove, like maybe being allergic to fish. Not in the history books. How do I prove that in my history homework?” </p>
 
 <p>If he and Valerie could consider the consequences of using ghost powers to cheat on homework, they’d have to consider the consequences of using ghost powers to do homework legitimately, too.</p>
 
 <p>“I’m sure you can make up some excuse about ghost experiments that your parents did,” Valerie responded. “Don’t forget that you’re a <em>Fenton</em>. Take advantage of that.” </p>
 
 <p>Right. Of course. Danny wasn’t <em>only</em> Fenton or Phantom, he was <em>both</em>. He sometimes forgot that – especially because he lived his whole life being embarrassed for being a Fenton. </p>
 
 <p>“Thanks, Valerie,” Danny smiled.</p>
 
 <p>Danny caught the blush on her cheeks before she pulled up the textbook to hide her face. </p>
 
 <p>Their studying got interrupted by the Box Ghost raiding The Container Store. </p>
 
 <p>It wasn’t difficult, but it was annoying and Danny was in no mood to resume studying. He could sense the same in Valerie. Danny bought a couple of milkshakes from the Nasty Burger, the two sat on the rooftop of a tall building, the sunset looked beautiful; it was almost beginning to feel like a real date. </p>
 
 <p>“Oh shit, the library closes in 20 minutes!”</p>
 
 <p>And just like that, their date ended. </p>
 
 <p>They grabbed their backpacks and books from the library table and ran out. </p>
 
 <p>Somehow, they were more winded by hurrying to leave the library than from flying around dodging boxes thrown at them from the Box Ghost. Maybe it was the thrill of being outside their vigilante personas. </p>
 
 <p>“That, that was close,” Valerie said. “My house keys and my laptop were in there,” </p>
 
 <p>“Hey, if we ever got locked out, I could always, you know, sneak us in,” Danny said. “To get our stuff! Sneak us in to get our stuff!” </p>
 
 <p>Valerie laughed. </p>
 
 <p>“Well, I enjoyed our date,” Valerie said. </p>
 
 <p>Danny breathed a sigh of relief. He hated studying but liked spending time with Valerie, so it canceled out for him, but he wasn’t sure what Valerie thought of their date as a whole, interruptions and everything.</p>
 
 <p>“I did too,” Danny admitted. “Let me plan the next date,”</p>
 
 <p>“Sure,” Valerie blushed. </p>
 
 <p>Danny had planned to patrol town for a little bit, but decided to visit the ghost zone instead. He knows that Red Huntress sometimes patrols town too, and it would have been infuriating to have cut their date short only to end up patrolling town at the same time, and he wanted to do something <em>more</em> with Valerie, beyond just the convenience of their shared time hunting ghosts. </p>
 
 <p>Besides, Valerie made him curious enough to visit some of the other ghosts that he knew.</p>
 
 <p>One of these ghosts was Pandora. </p>
 
 <p>Sidney introduced Danny to Pandora a few months ago – after Sidney was convinced Danny wasn’t actually a bully. While ghosts, by definition, are something that was once alive, Danny isn’t sure that Pandora fits that definition, because her height (10 feet tall) and the number of arms she has (4, but sometimes 6) could not have been from a living human.</p>
 
 <p>(Danny isn’t sure if he himself fits that definition either, for different reasons)</p>
 
 <p>Danny wondered if her form was altered ‘after death’, kind of like how Technus and Vlad changed their look over time, or if she was always a ghost, ‘born’ or ‘formed’ from the very fabric of the Ghost Zone. Did she inspire the legend of the Greek myth surrounding Pandora’s Box, or did the collective belief of the myth bring her into being? And are there others like her? </p>
 
 <p>However she came to be, she is a powerful guardian of sorts; she guards boxes and containers of… Danny isn’t sure <em>what</em> exactly, but all he knows is that they are artifacts of power that should not fall into the wrong hands. Pandora had told him a couple of stories of what has happened when they <em>do</em> fall into the wrong hands.</p>
 
 <p>A ghost with powerful artifacts and knowledge is bound to help him meet the ghost of a famous scientist – or point him in the right direction to do that. Maybe. </p>
 
 <p>Danny flew around aimlessly in the Ghost Zone, until he found Sidney’s lair. A sense of direction in the Ghost Zone was difficult, in that lairs and floating islands weren’t tethered to spots in reality, but following some invisible orbit, as if they were planets in an unknown system. Danny navigated using relative landmarks, which seemed to group certain ectoplasmic bodies together, and found Pandora’s island some ways off. </p>
 
 <p>Her lair was a town on an island – fields, homes, roads. If Danny had to guess, the architecture was probably from a certain era of Greek history. Many spirits wandered around the ghost town, continuing their lifestyle even in death, but Pandora herself was in the Acropolis, overlooking the town itself. Danny flew to the front and knocked at the door. She answered after the first knock.</p>
 
 <p>“Hello, Phantom,” </p>
 
 <p>“Hi, Pandora,”</p>
 
 <p>Good, straight to the point and no riddles yet.</p>
 
 <p>He’d only visited Pandora once before, when he was looking for a place to hide Eragon’s necklace – the artifact that transformed the ghost prince into a powerful dragon – and Pandora led him around in riddles before agreeing to store the necklace for safe keeping. </p>
 
 <p>“So, I need to ask – did someone steal Eragon’s necklace from your vaults? He attacked Amity Park a few months ago in his dragon form,” Danny shook the thermos in his hand, containing the thermos that had said necklace. While Eragon was returned to the ghost zone, Danny had since kept that necklace inside a Fenton Thermos – he had,... procrastinated on bringing the necklace back to Pandora, since he wasn’t sure it wouldn’t be stolen from her again. </p>
 
 <p>Pandora gave a cryptic smile. </p>
 
 <p>“I owed a favor to a friend; I cannot say much about him. You will meet him soon, though from <em>his</em> perspective, the meeting has already happened.” </p>
 
 <p>Ah, there were the riddles. But Danny was more experienced with riddles now than he was before! </p>
 
 <p>"A meeting with another ghost that will happen soon, and has already happened… is what I came to ask <em>you</em> about, actually,” Danny responded. The necklace wasn’t the only thing he came to Pandora about.</p>
 
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
 
 <p>“I mean, people from the past who are ghosts now – their past is my future when I learn about them and talk to them, in some roundabout way.” A little bit of redirection, but it was working in his favor. “Can I visit any of those ghosts? Or talk to them?”  </p>
 
 <p>“Ah,” Pandora’s confusion eased out. “I was forewarned about this. Follow me.” </p>
 
 <p>She heads deeper into her domain, and Danny follows. Something about flipping the riddle back on his head to reveal the solution worked last time, and this time it coincided with his goal, so he must have solved Pandora’s riddle properly this time – maybe.</p>
 
 <p>They float through a hallway lined with pedestals that hold various vases and boxes, each one decorated to describe the artifact they contain. </p>
 
 <p>“To some degree, you can visit other ghosts – if you <em>know</em> about them, that is,” They stop in front of one pedestal, and Pandora pulls out a keyboard from a nondescript box. “And you cannot know about ghosts without searching. This tool can help with that.” </p>
 
 <p>Pandora was letting him <em>use</em> an ancient artifact? And that ancient artifact was a <em>keyboard</em>? </p>
 
 <p>“What? Are you sure about this?” Danny was flabbergasted. “Keyboards are a modern invention, aren’t they? This can’t be an ancient artifact!” </p>
 
 <p>“I never said powerful artifacts were ancient – you just assumed that,” Pandora chuckled. “Besides, this particular artifact conforms its interface to what its user is familiar with. It’s a search tome, that can tell you information about ghosts.” </p>
 
 <p>Danny rested his hands on the floating keyboard, and a holographic screen popped up in front of him. A <em>ghost computer</em>, Technus would be <em>frothing</em> at the mouth if he got his hands on this. Okay, focus! Danny wanted to search up ghosts of famous scientists,<em> that’s </em>what he had come here to ask Pandora about to begin with. Okay. </p>
 
 <p>Danny typed in “Marie Curie<em>”,</em> hit the enter key, and found a single search result. He clicked on it using the trackpad on the keyboard, and it opened a single image. He stared a bit at the symbols and images, trying to understand what he saw. </p>
 
 <p>“That’s a map, isn’t it?” Danny asked. “A map to her… lair?”</p>
 
 <p>“That it is,” Pandora confirmed. </p>
 
 <p>Danny looked back at the map – it looked pretty far from here, wherever “here” was, and he didn’t want to leave the keyboard either. He tried another search term: “Nikola Tesla” – the search result showed him the location to (and a picture of) Technus’s lair, which he had passed by on his way to Pandora’s. </p>
 
 <p>“Not all ghosts retain their original sense of self, do they?” Danny asked.</p>
 
 <p>“No they don’t,” Pandora responded. “Many can get corrupted, just as this one you searched, and each ghost has varying levels of awareness of their state of being. There are even some who do not know they have died, and are reliving their favorite memories of their life on a loop within their lair, to come to terms with their deaths” </p>
 
 <p>Would that be Danny one day, when he goes from half ghost to full ghost? He shook that thought out of his mind and hit the back button immediately. </p>
 
 <p>Danny could theoretically search up the ghosts of any famous figure in history, and interview them for… anything. Just like Valerie thought. Assuming the ghosts hadn’t been corrupted, still retained their sense of self, and were nice enough to let Danny interview them in some way.</p>
 
 <p>“If this is meant to be a search tome, it should be able to tell me about ghosts even if I don’t know their names, right?” Danny mused. “Like a search engine. Like a ghost google.” </p>
 
 <p>“Something like that,” Pandora affirmed. </p>
 
 <p>His fingertips itched with power; the possibilities of which ghosts he could learn from, the potential to have all of human history as an asset was intoxicating. It was one thing to interview a famous president from hundreds of years ago, it was another to be tutored by a famous scientist. Oh, Barry would be <em>so</em> jealous. </p>
 
 <p>He entered a new search term: “famous scientists who died in the past 30 years” and hit enter. He didn’t want to scare a potential ghost tutor away with culture shock, so it would probably be best to stick to recently deceased scientists. This time, the search results returned a list of names he’d have to sift through. Some of the names were familiar – he’d heard his parents discuss some of these names in passing, while discussing breakthroughs in adjacent scientific fields. He scrolled through the list, and paused. </p>
 
 <p>There was one name in the search results that did not belong.</p>
 
 <p>“Hey Pandora,” the large ghost was idling by, supervising Danny’s use of the keyboard. He couldn’t believe that Pandora was just <em>letting</em> him use it, it was incredibly powerful. </p>
 
 <p>“What happens when there’s multiple people with the same name in the search results?” </p>
 
 <p>“That happens more often than you think,” Pandora responded. “Have you <em>seen</em> the British royalty? They keep reusing the same names! If you ever search them up, you have to be careful that you have the right person. Humans reuse names all the time.” </p>
 
 <p>That…</p>
 
 <p>“So if someone who’s de– someone who’s a <em>ghost</em> has the same name as someone who’s <em>alive</em>… it’s entirely possible that’s a coincidence, right?” </p>
 
 <p>“It <em>could </em>be,” </p>
 
 <p>Danny clicked the suspicious search result, opening a map to their lair. It was… far. </p>
 
 <p>“Do you think I could go visit this one?” Danny pointed. </p>
 
 <p>“Sure,” Pandora took off one of her necklaces and gave it to Danny. “So long as you wear this, you can teleport yourself back here instantly.” </p>
 
 <p>“And you’re just gonna <em>let me</em> go and visit another ghost’s lair? No riddle?” </p>
 
 <p>“See, I’d rather have brought the ghost <em>here</em>, rather than send you to them,” Pandora mused. “But that would require summoning a ghost, which is not something I, or any artifact, can do; only the Ghost King can do that. So the next best thing is for you to go to them. Besides, you learn so much more when you visit a person in their homes instead of inviting them out.” </p>
 
 <p>Danny couldn’t help but feel like this entire visit was a riddle thus far, one he hadn’t figured out yet. He sighed; at least she wasn’t stopping him.</p>
 
 <p>He moved the pointer to click on the ghost’s lair, and a portal opened up next to him. Danny clutched the amulet Pandora gave him, and went through it, arriving outside the ghost lair of one Dr. Harrison Wells. </p>
 
 <p><em>Please please <strong>please</strong> let this be a coincidence</em>, Danny thought. </p>
 
 <p>The lair was a nondescript two story building atop a floating island, the kind Danny wouldn’t glance at twice while flying through the Zone. The front door was open, so he went inside. Inside was a… not a lab, but a research abode of sorts; papers and books haphazardly placed across multiple desks and the floor. Some beakers on one of the tables. The most eye-catching part of the room was the giant bubble of ectoplasm floating in the middle. </p>
 
 <p>“What… is that?” </p>
 
 <p>Danny leaned in close to the ecto-bubble. He could… see <em>something</em> inside. It was tinted green, but he could see people inside, talking to each other. Were they… trapped inside? Was the ecto-bubble a solid shield? Maybe he could free them. Danny touched the surface of the bubble – it was semi solid, but his hand passed through. </p>
 
 <p>The noise of shattering glass behind him caught his attention. </p>
 
 <p>“Oh no! Don’t touch that!” A ghost in a lab coat came into the room. “I was researching that! It might suck you in!”</p>
 
 <p>Danny felt a <em>tug</em> and couldn’t stop himself from getting pulled inside, almost like the bubble was <em>eating </em>him. He yelled and reached out for the other ghost, their hands almost touching before Danny was swallowed whole. </p>
 
 <p>-</p>
 
 <p>The first sight Danny could see a younger Wells, a newly minted PhD, sitting at a cafeteria table at what Danny presumed was inside his university. He looked just like the picture that was on his Wikipedia page. He was poring over his blueprints with a few white coated colleagues of his. Everyone was eating slices of pizza. Danny walked over to them, peeking over a few shoulders to look at the blueprints. He saw a familiar logo on the bottom right. </p>
 
 <p>“Star Labs,” Danny noted. </p>
 
 <p>“Yes, for cutting edge research into the future of physics!” the ghost of young-looking Wells responded. “You don’t think it sounds cheesy do you? Tess thinks it sounds cheesy.” </p>
 
 <p>Danny was caught off guard. </p>
 
 <p>“I… don’t think it’s cheesy, actually,” Danny responded. “I mean, I like astronomy so I might be a little biased here.”   </p>
 
 <p>“Wonderful! Thank you for breaking the tie on our vote!” The ghost of Wells shook Danny’s hand. “You saved it from being named ‘Central Labs’ which is honestly just <em>lame</em>,” </p>
 
 <p>“It’s <em>not </em>lame! It’s –” </p>
 
 <p>Ghost-Wells’s peers start to argue over each other, and a plate of pizza gets knocked over to the ground. Danny bends down to pick it up – surprised that he can interact with it – and gets back up to a completely different scene in front of him. </p>
 
 <p>He’s in a church, watching two people at the altar recite their wedding vows to each other. Tess and Wells get married and get ready to throw their bouquet into the crowd. </p>
 
 <p>“When did you all get here?” </p>
 
 <p>People gather into a group, hoping to catch the flowers. No one responds to Danny’s question, but Wells looks at Danny with a laugh, and throws the bouquet towards him. He catches the flowers, and briefly wonders if pizza and flowers would be good for a date with Valerie – but maybe not flowers like these, that might appear too forward. </p>
 
 <p>The flowers wilt in his hand, and the scene changes in front of him. There’s the burning wreckage of a car crash, Wells crying over his wife’s death. </p>
 
 <p>Danny knows this; he knows that Harrison Wells’s wife, Tess Morgan, was killed in a car crash 7 years ago. He knows that Wells was severely injured in the same car crash, though it didn’t lead to paralysis like his injuries in the particle accelerator explosion did. What he <em>doesn’t</em> know is why the Yellow Flash appears in this memory. The yellow speedster proceeds to stab Harrison Wells in the heart.</p>
 
 <p>A ghost in a lab coat appears next to Danny, watching the scene unfold in front of him.  </p>
 
 <p>“Sorry you had to see that,” He admitted. “I don’t get visitors often.”</p>
 
 <p>The same ghost from– from outside the ghost bubble, Danny suddenly remembered. </p>
 
 <p>“This is inside? Inside the bubble?” he asked.</p>
 
 <p>“Yes, it seems to replay core memories of mine. I’ve been trying to research it, figure out how it came to be or if I can make more,”</p>
 
 <p>…Ghost bubbles… </p>
 
 <p>“Since it’s going through my memories, it’s easy for me to get in and out. I’m not sure about other ghosts though, since I don’t get any visitors.”</p>
 
 <p>…made of semi solid ectoplasm that were neurological imprints of once living beings… fuck…</p>
 
 <p>“I should be able to get you out easily though.” </p>
 
 <p>…his parents were often <em>wrong</em> about ghost stuff, but were they– were they actually <em>right</em> about this thing? They’d never even seen a ghost bubble before, but <em>this</em> fit their paradigm, their definition of “ghosts”, even if he – and some of the other ghosts – didn’t. </p>
 
 <p>But, it’s not like the ecto-bubble hurt anybody (intentionally) but it wasn’t the same type of ‘ghost’ that Danny and most other ghosts were either. </p>
 
 <p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t introduce myself, I’m Harrison Wells,” the lab coat ghost said. “And you are–?” </p>
 
 <p>Danny gathered as much – he was inside an ecto-bubble within Harrison Wells’s lair, so the only  other self aware ghost must be him. </p>
 
 <p>“I’m… Danny Phantom,” he responded.</p>
 
 <p>So those were real memories and it had some people he knew, but those memories didn’t answer <em>anything</em>; this is <em>worse</em> than any riddle Pandora could have come up with. </p>
 
 <p>Was this Wells the one that Danny knew? </p>

 <p>“You don’t happen to know of any species of nearly extinct animals in the Amity Park Zoo, do you?” Danny asked. </p>

 <p>“I’m sorry, Biology isn’t my field of study,” Labcoat-Wells responded.</p>

 <p>So, not <em>his</em> Wells then. It was the wrong answer to the ‘code phrase’. But what could that mean? </p>

 <p>“Sorry, I’m just– I thought– I’m so <em>confused</em>!” Danny pointed back to the echo of the memory playing out in front of them. “W-Why did that guy–?” </p>

 <p>Was this an alternate version of history playing out in front of him?</p>

 <p>“I wish I knew,” Labcoat-Wells stared on as Yellow Flash from the memory pulls his hand out of Memory-Wells’s body, and pulls back his mask. The yellow speedster’s face begins to morph into that of Harrison Wells. That shouldn’t have been possible – the Yellow Flash didn’t even <em>exist</em> prior to the particle accelerator explosion, this –</p>
 
 <p>“I mean, he just lived as me and ended up doing everything I was going to do anyway.” Labcoat-Wells mused. “Why go through all that work? To steal glory? Why not live <em>with</em> me instead of <em>as</em> me?” </p>
 
 <p>Wells-Flash looked up. At Danny? Towards Danny? Was he part of the memory-echo, or was he like Danny and Labcoat-Wells, from outside the bubble? </p>
 
 <p>He didn’t wait to find out; he pressed a button on his amulet and one breath later he was back in Pandora’s island, right in front of the keyboard and floating display that he’d left. Danny gasped for breath, trembling from fear.</p>
 
 <p>“What did you see?” Pandora asked. </p>
 
 <p>“I –he was –! I don’t understand!”</p>
 
 <p>“Most riddles are like that,” Pandora responded. </p>
 
 <p>Danny breathed in gulps of air, reminding himself he was no longer there.</p>
 
 <p>“But I thought –?” He sighed. Last time he’d come here, Pandora’s riddles were obstacles instead of cryptic non answers. She helped him try to find the answers to his own questions – but that led to even more questions. </p>
 
 <p>“Why’d you let me go so easily? Without any riddle?” Danny finally asked.</p>
 
 <p>“Because I was <em>asked</em> to do so,” </p>
 
 <p>Danny was surprised to get a real answer this time, but knowing Pandora, it would only lead to more frustrating questions. </p>
 
 <p>“By <em>who</em>?” And maybe, this was the part of the ‘riddle’ where he had to connect dots. “Was it the same pers– the same ghost who took Eragon’s amulet out of your storage?” </p>
 
 <p>“Yes,” </p>
 
 <p>If they asked Pandora to let Danny use artifacts under her care, if they took an artifact that Danny had asked Pandora to store… well, they probably didn’t have to steal Eragon’s necklace from Pandora – it was probably <em>given</em> to them. Someone who was watching Danny’s actions. Did he have a stalker? Was it Vlad? Or someone else? </p>
 
 <p>“Who are they? And why–?”</p>
 
 <p>“I’ll tell you again what I told you before,” Pandora interrupted. “You will meet him soon, though from <em>his</em> perspective, the meeting has already happened.” </p>
 
 <p>Who is this ghost that has Pandora’s cooperation? What are their goals? And how does Danny’s use of the ghost searching artifact help achieve those goals? </p>
 
 <p>Another, more pressing, question overwhelmed his mind.</p>
 
 <p>Just <em>who</em> was Dr. Harrison Wells? And who – or <em>what</em> – was the Yellow Flash?</p>
