<p>If Barry could’ve predicted the domino effect of Cisco hacking into CCTV leading to a return trip to Amity Park, he would’ve stopped his friend a lot sooner. </p>

<p>In hindsight, he <em>should’ve</em> predicted it – Cisco was observing CCTV footage of Phantom fights, and taking notes. The ghost always fights alone, never attacks another human, and is incredibly powerful. Sometimes the Fentons, or the red suited huntress, land a good hit on Phantom, but he never fires back at them. </p>

<p>Too bad there wasn’t good CCTV footage from the ‘kidnapping mayor’ or ‘jewelry theft’ incident. Who knows if those out of character incidents had some deeper meaning that was erased, alongside the footage. </p>

<p>There were a couple instances of ghosts breaking loose from Amity Park though, just like the first time he met Phantom – since there was no CCTV footage of these incidents, Cisco had to rely on grainy cell phone footage on social media, or news reports. </p>

<p>The ghosts never got very far; usually Phantom would stop them before they could reach another city, and suck them up in his little <strike>pokeball</strike> thermos. One time, a red suited hunteress on a hoverboard stopped a ghost outside Amity Park, and also used a thermos – maybe they were working together with the Fentons, and advertising Fenton products? Barry wasn’t sure, but it looked like red was a popular color. </p>

<p>“I think the Fentons’ inventions could be the key to mitigating our meta-human crisis!” Cisco exclaimed one day without warning, after examining hours of footage.</p>

<p>Caitlyn stopped the titration she was working on, and Dr. Wells looked up from his computer. </p>

<p>“How so?” </p>

<p>Cisco typed away at his computer, and showed a CCTV feed of Phantom from a couple months ago. The video started after a ghost crashed into a four story building across the street, and a girl – who must’ve been watching the ghost fight from the roof – tumbled over, free-falling into the ground. Phantom caught her before she fell too far, but something shocked him. Phantom’s face contorted in pain as visible sparks of electricity sizzled across his entire form, but he never dropped the girl. The electric shocks stopped once Phantom safely deposited her on the street, but Barry could see what Cisco was most interested in.</p>

<p>“The shocks only hurt Phantom, and not the girl at all,” Dr. Wells observed.</p>

<p>“Not only that –” Barry’s eyes honed in on her odd fashion choices. The chunky gray belt that didn't match her black top or black-green skirt. “The girl was wearing a Specter Deflector.”</p>

<p>“Right, so I took a look at the one Barry got from the Fentons – I promise I put it back together after that, Barry!” </p>

<p>Cisco showed photos of a dismantled metallic belt, showing the wires and circuitry inside. It took Cisco a LOT of convincing Barry for him to even <em>touch</em> the belt – Barry refused to take it off for a solid week. The belt itself was once again safely reassembled, after Cisco was done. </p>

<p>Barry hadn’t worn the belt in a while though. He was getting too many odd looks for his bad fashion choices, and ghosts hadn’t come close to Central City since that day.</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful feat of custom engineering. Chef's kiss.” Cisco said, miming the action by lightly kissing his pinched fingers. “But anyway – I thought to myself, could I understand how they did it? Could I replicate it? Imagine if I could have just one type of ‘metahuman handcuff’ – instead of targeting their powers, I could target them at a molecular level.”</p>

<p>Caitlyn caught the gist. </p>

<p>“Every single person in Central City was irradiated with dark matter, but someone who’s a meta-human has it in greater quantities in their bodies. If we can sense that radiation and define a threshold, we could tell if a person was a meta or a non-meta.” </p>

<p>“And then if said cuffs could ‘dampen’ or ‘absorb’ the dark matter, nullifying its effects in the whole body –” </p>

<p>“We could get rid of the metas from the Pipeline. Safely hold them in Iron Heights.” Barry finished.</p>

<p>No normal prison could hold meta-human criminals – the other inmates and guards would be in danger, with meta-humans using their powers to break out. They couldn’t always kill meta-human criminals either, so the cavities inside the Particle Accelerator’s core chamber were repurposed into jail cells. </p>

<p>Those cavities didn’t dampen meta-human powers – they were just strong enough to withstand super strength and extreme temperatures. It was a bandaid to a fire hydrant that threatened to explode; StarLabs was footing the bill to house prisoners without a stable income source, and it was a matter of time before they captured a meta-human with unique powers that couldn’t be contained by the Pipeline. </p>

<p>…Could Phantom ever be contained by the Pipeline? Barry hoped he’d never have to find out. </p><hr />

<p>Barry and Cisco set to work to recreate a functional ‘Specter Deflector’, with varying degrees of success. They didn’t have any ‘specters’ to test the ‘deflector’ on, and two of the prototypes short circuited within minutes. There were custom components in the Fentons’ version that Cisco tried to recreate with substitutes, without much luck. Caitlyn theorized that a magnetic pulse or shock could disrupt dark matter activity in the body temporarily – and while it was a promising theory, no one was willing to test it on Barry, or the metas locked in the Pipeline… yet. </p>

<p>Barry was brainstorming a few more ideas to work around, when Cisco interrupted his thoughts with the <em>worst</em> possible idea.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to Amity Park,” </p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“C’mon Barry! You have to introduce me to the Fentons!” </p>

<p>The Star Labs’ team knew of his reservations after his Amity Park trip, and the fact that the ghost boy knew his identity. What Barry kept for himself, though, was just <em>how</em> dangerous and otherworldly Phantom was – the fact that his hand rummaged inside Barry’s chest for a brief second was not easy to share with anyone. </p>

<p>“Phantom is creepy, okay!” Barry admitted. </p>

<p>“But he’s not a bad guy!” Cisco said. “You can wear your Specter Deflector, and if any ghostly voodoo shit starts happening you can zip us out of there! It’ll be perfectly fine!” </p>

<p>“Ghostly voodoo? Is that a real thing?” Caitlyn asked, concern and disbelief in her voice. </p>

<p>“I sure hope not!” </p>

<p>Barry gave it some thought. In the short time he spent in Amity Park, Phantom always ran <em>away</em> when the Fentons showed up; online chatter confirmed his observation. So, if he wanted to stay away from Phantom, it stood that he should be in the company of the Fentons as long as possible – at least while in Amity Park. </p>

<p>“Alright, fine. Let’s go, Cisco.” Barry conceded. He could ask Jack follow up questions about his papers and synthesizing ectoplasm too, so it <em>could</em> be worthwhile. Especially if they could learn how to protect themselves against ghosts. </p>

<p>“Just for the weekend,” Dr. Wells said sternly. “We don’t want Central City to be without their Flash for too long. You do have to keep up with your training, Barry.”</p>

<p>Speed training was such an <em>odd</em> concept for Barry to wrap his mind around – shouldn’t using his super speed to commute count as training? Why should he run <em>more</em> than he needs to? Regardless, he tried his best to stick to a schedule, but he had been falling behind on the training that Dr. Wells had set up for him. </p>

<p>Despite Barry’s ability to commute at super speed, he decided it would be best to commute by car. He wasn’t confident in his ability to travel that far and that fast with another person <em>just yet, </em>and hopefully stopping to pay for gas along the way won’t flag his credit card for fraud when he inevitably uses it again to pay for a hotel in Amity Park. </p><hr />

<p>“Barry! So good to see you, pal! Rocking that Specter Deflector I see!” </p>

<p>They had called ahead, and the Fentons were hospitable and delighted as always. </p>

<p>“Hi Jack, this my friend Cisco, who I mentioned earlier –” </p>

<p>“Your work is <em>amazing</em> I have so many questions and do you sell your stuff? I want three of everything. Well maybe whatever I can fit in my budget. Seriously your work is–”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come inside Fentonworks first?” Maddie said. </p>

<p>Cisco was a kid in a candy shop – but the candy shop was actually a lab that pioneered science, and the kid was an inventor who couldn't wait to get his hands on cutting edge science. Sure, StarLabs also pioneered science, but it also had funding and state of the art tools – Cisco wasn’t entirely sure how the Fentons funded their lab, but they must be beyond geniuses if they could pioneer science in the confines of their own<em> basement</em>. </p>

<p>Just like the last time Barry was here, with Iris, the basement-lab was lined with shelves of knick knacks and inventions; some in progress, some completed, some broken. Tables lined with tools and test tubes with glowing green liquid. Papers with notes and annotations strewn across several tables. Barry had been here before, but only now could he fully appreciate the lab for how much love and time was invested into it. </p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to replicate the mini ecto-sensor you put in the belt, to make a dark matter sensor,” Cisco explained to Jack. “But there’s a few components here that I couldn’t fully replicate, and–” </p>

<p>“Oh yes, I invented that a few years ago, it’s used in a few of our inventions –” </p>

<p>“And the melting point of this metal is pretty high – great for storing ectoplasm as fuel and fire, hard to smelt in manufacturing,” </p>

<p>“Oh, what if you synthesized ectoplasm in the barrel?”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea, young man! It’s currently a work in progress!”</p>

<p>While Barry had some background in engineering, it wasn’t as extensive as Cisco’s; he’d always prefered the discipline of chemistry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t fully finish reading all these, but I had some questions about the studies referenced here –” Barry said to Maddie. </p>

<p>“Oh my, you finished reading a lot more than I thought you would since we last saw you!” </p>

<p>Barry would’ve read a lot more if not for him freaking out over Phantom. </p>

<p>They discussed blueprints, reagents, techniques for best practices, lab stories; in so many ways, Jack and Maddie Fenton reminded Barry of his StarLabs team – like friends. He wished he could work with them more often, but maybe he’d sit out on practical demonstrations of their work – he didn’t want to deal with a ghost just yet. </p>

<p>“I’m sorry for taking so much of your time on a weekend,” Barry said. “I still have so many questions and I didn’t want to take time away from your kids or  –”</p>

<p>“It’s not a problem, Barry! It’s much easier to focus on sciences now that our kids are older and able to take care of themselves!” The stink eye that the Fenton boy gave him when he entered the house might argue otherwise, but Barry kept silent. </p>

<p>After several more hours, and a brief lunch break, Barry had new ideas he wanted to try for Ectoplasm based inventions, and explore the possibility to harness it as a long term energy source. Cisco managed to decompose and understand the custom components inside several Fenton inventions – including the Specter Deflector; overall, their trip was a win. </p>

<p>“Since we’re only here for the weekend, we’ll leave for Central City tomorrow evening,” Barry said. </p>

<p>He was glad their visit was so short. No time for tourism, no time for ghost attacks, no time to accidentally run into Phantom without his Flash suit on. And even if they did run into Phantom, the ghost would fly away the moment Barry was seen with the Fentons. Hanging out with the ghost experts was that it was the safest way to escape from ghosts, and Barry wanted to do it as much as possible.</p>

<p>“Please stop by again any time you visit Amity Park!” Maddie said. </p>

<p>“Will do!” </p>

<p>Barry and Cisco’s arms were loaded with gadgetry purchased from Fentonworks – at a discount price, not only for the sheer volume they purchased, but also because of their new found friendship. The Fentons informally agreed to consult for StarLabs on an adhoc basis (and vice versa), and they’d have to formally draft the agreement after they finished traveling. </p>

<p>Well, if one good thing came from Cisco hacking into CCTV footage, it was forging new professional connections and relationships. </p><hr />

<p>“You know,” Cisco thought aloud while examining the Fenton weapons and gadgets in the hotel room. “The last time you came to Amity Park, there were two ghost attacks in as many days. I haven’t even seen a single ghost yet!”</p>

<p>“Please don’t jinx it Cisco.”</p>

<p>“Too late.” a disembodied voice responded from the ceiling. </p>

<p>Barry fumbled with a Fenton ecto-blaster, turning left and right while trying to aim it at the invisible source of the voice, while Cisco struggled to close a Specter Deflector around his waist. </p>

<p>“Chill out, you two!” Phantom made himself visible from the ceiling, hands up in the air in a gesture of peace. </p>

<p>“You look like you’ve seen a ghost, heh.” </p>

<p>Logically, Cisco knew Phantom was a <em>good guy</em>, but it was better to be safe than sorry. There was a reason Barry went a whole week without taking off the Specter Deflector, and Cisco didn’t pry, but wondered how much of that had to do with surprise ghost attacks – or even just Phantom himself. </p>

<p>“What do you want with us!?” Cisco arms shook while aiming a blaster in Danny’s direction. “Oh my god I finally saw a ghost without using a summoning circle I can totally cross that off my bucket list,” </p>

<p>“Your bucket list is meaningless if you’re– nevermind.” Phantom sighed. “I came here to apologize, and to give you something.” </p>

<p>“Apologize,...for?” </p>

<p>“For spooking you, Flash.” </p>

<p>Barry and Cisco froze, weapons in hand. </p>

<p>“Oh my god he knows you’re the Flash,” Cisco whispered without taking his eyes off of Phantom. </p>

<p>“Cisco, you already knew that he knew!” Barry whispered back. Still, it was different seeing it play out in the flesh. </p>

<p>“So <em>you’re </em>Cisco! Look I can still hear you both,” Phantom said with an amused smirk. The two humans whipped their heads, attention refocused on the ghost. Neither said anything, so Phantom resumed speaking.</p>

<p>“Look, I just wanna say: that time, when I said ‘get out’, I wasn’t talking to you; I was talking to the ghost that was trying to overshadow – ah, possess you. I had to stick my hand in to get that ghost out myself. I sent him back to the ghost zone, and he probably escaped again, but he’ll be sure to leave you alone, at least.” </p>

<p>“So you’re saying,..” </p>

<p>Barry lowered his gun ever so slightly, realization dawning.</p>

<p>“You freaking exorcized me!” Barry almost screamed. “I thought you were gonna kill me! For real!” </p>

<p>“Yeah, sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you and I was gonna explain afterwards, but you left before I could. I guess you could say… that wasn’t <em>Barry </em>nice of you.” Phantom snickered.</p>

<p>Barry groaned, while Cisco laughed at his friend’s expense. Seeing Barry’s posture relaxing slightly, weapon angled down, Cisco also lowered his weapon. He didn’t know the full context of Phantom’s apology; that’d be for later, during their drive back to Central City. </p>

<p>“So… you’re a ghost?” Cisco asked. “A ghost who fights other ghosts?”</p>

<p>“Well, duh. Only the bad ones though.”</p>

<p>“Can I adopt you?”</p>

<p>“Legally? No.” </p>

<p>“Wait, you mean I can illegally adopt you?” </p>

<p>Phantom ignored Cisco’s question in favor of his second agenda. He unhooked the familiar cylindrical device from his belt, and presented it forward. </p>

<p>“I wanted to give you two <em>this</em>.” </p>

<p>“That’s a …Fenton Thermos? Why?” Barry asked. </p>

<p>It could ensnare any ghost. Phantom was a ghost. And Phantom was giving it <em>to them</em>.</p>

<p>“In case something like Box Ghost happens in Central City again – or worse. I might not always… be able to help stop a ghost that decides to take a field trip to your town. I’m not as fast as you. But you can trap the ghost in these, and then give it to me. I’ll send those ghosts back to the ghost zone, and then give you an empty thermos again.”</p>

<p>Barry was about to take the thermos, but pulled his hand back.</p>

<p>“We could easily use it on you, trap <em>you</em> in the thermos.” Barry pointed out. </p>

<p>“I know. I trust you <em>not</em> to.” </p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“We got off on the wrong foot. I know you don’t like me, and I don’t have the energy to care or change your mind. I know I don’t work well with others, but I know you care about protecting people, and protecting your town, so I will trust <em>that.</em>” </p>

<p>An olive branch. Barry thought that it would be an extremely tough villain that required a team up that would force an olive branch, but Phantom was offering it first, of his own free will. </p>

<p>Barry took the thermos, stared at it in his hand. Then stared at Phantom, solemnly. </p>

<p>“Won’t… Won’t you need a thermos of your own, Phantom?” Cisco asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, I can always get more.”</p>

<p>Getting a <em>Fenton</em> thermos was no problem for <em>Phantom? </em></p>

<p>“So… What <em>is</em> your connection to Danny Fenton?” Cisco broached. “Because I ha– I’m curious.” </p>

<p>Phantom did a double take, before steeling his face. </p>

<p>“What makes you think I even <em>have</em> one? Is it because of my name? The fact that I used a Fenton Thermos? That’s kinda weak evidence, isn’t it?” </p>

<p>“Because you and the Fenton kid have a 79% match when run against facial recognition software.” </p>

<p>Phantom looked nervous. Was that sweat in his brow? Ghosts could sweat?</p>

<p>“Who were you, before you –”</p>

<p>“Don’t.” Phantom interrupted. “Please don’t ask me ‘who I was’ <em>before</em>.”</p>

<p>“Wh–?”</p>

<p>“It’s rude.”</p>

<p>Barry startled, before an odd thought struck him. Do ghosts not like being asked about their past because they don’t <em>remember</em> their past, or how they died? Does Phantom not know his own connection to the Fentons – to <em>Danny</em> Fenton – and is he trying to figure it out, too? </p>

<p>Barry somehow doubted that, but Phantom was awfully good at deflecting questions, so it didn’t matter if that was true or not – they weren’t going to find out anytime soon. A ghost as powerful as Phantom was bound to have some closely guarded secrets, and why would he share those with strangers?</p>

<p>“But you know who I am,” Barry pointed out. “It’s not fair that you know something about me that very few people know.”</p>

<p>“I’m not obligated to share a secret just because you couldn’t keep yours,” Phantom responded. “I was lucky enough to piece together what little I did know about you, and you’re not as slick as you think you are.”</p>

<p>Barry and Cisco didn’t know what to make of that. StarLabs and Joe were the only ones who knew, and Joe covered for him at work, so his secret should stay a secret, right? But on his last Amity Park visit, he didn’t have Star Labs or Joe with him.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it’s because I’m a ghost? But be careful with what you say I guess.” </p>

<p>Did Phantom just hang out all day in Amity Park and snoop around people’s secrets? That was the only explanation Barry could think, for how Phantom found out who he was. </p>

<p>“Anyway!” Phantom’s tone changed to a much more upbeat one. “Don’t tell the Fentons that I gave you a thermos. If they’re confused about it, pretend you got it from them all along!” </p>

<p>“What do I do when the thermos gets full?” Barry asked. He knew how it was meant to be used, based on Cisco’s CCTV marathon, but he could see that it had a limited capacity, based on the gauge markings on the side. </p>

<p>“Hmm… message me on Twitter.” </p>

<p>“You have a Twitter?”</p>

<p>“You don’t?”</p>

<p>“I-I mean I <em>do</em> have one,” Barry was just surprised at the notion of a <em>ghost</em> having a Twitter account.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Phantom pulled out a phone from one of his pockets. “What’s your username?” </p>

<p>“Oh,... just my first and last name, as one word,” Barry said. “@BarryAllen”</p>

<p>Phantom sighed. </p>

<p>“Don’t you have one for your red suit? You know? For Flash?” </p>

<p>Barry had considered it after seeing how Amity Park utilized a ‘ghost alert’ system. He just hadn’t gotten around to it. But he figured he didn’t need one yet.</p>

<p>“Can’t you just message me on @BarryAllen anyway?” </p>

<p>“Of course not! If my account is seen interacting with yours, it won’t take long for people to put two and two together and realize you’re the Flash.” </p>

<p>“It’d be easier to tag him in things,...” Cisco mused in agreement. “To make announcements, to secure partnerships or brand deals,... oh my god Barry you could get a blue checkmark!”</p>

<p>Phantom and Cisco convinced him to make a Twitter account right then and there. He was never very creative with usernames, so it was taking him longer than he would’ve liked.</p>

<p>“@TheFlash is taken already, looks like that account just sells NFTs. @TheRedStreak is also taken huh, by… oh a fan account,”  </p>

<p>“Good.” Phantom said. “Those sound like stripper names.” </p>

<p>If Cisco had a drink in his mouth, it would’ve gone flying right through the ghost boy. </p>

<p>“You don’t need to use your superhero name as your Twitter handle,” Phantom said without missing a beat. “You just need something that people remember about your power. The one thing that people won’t forget. And they’ll vibe with it.” </p>

<p>It took them a few tries before Barry settled on @TheFastestManAlive. His first follower was @DeadTired. </p><hr />

<p>Barry never used his phone at work. He only used it when he was on his lunch break, or he was waiting for the centrifuge to finish running, or he was waiting for the gel electrophoresis to finish, or for the fingerprint analysis to finish, or – okay, maybe Barry <em>did</em> use his phone a lot during work.</p>

<p>He would normally catch up on new advancements in the field of forensic science, and sometimes catch up on the regular news – usually through twitter. He was just an anonymous denizen of the internet, casually consuming the news and memes catered to him, specifically, and not participating in any drama or cancel culture. </p>

<p>So he was surprised when his phone was <em>abuzz</em> with notifications while at work. From Twitter. It didn’t take him long to find out why. </p>

<p>Phantom had mentioned him in a tweet.</p><blockquote>

<p>It occurred to Barry that he should look through Phantom’s tweets to see what kind of things the ghost boy likes or retweets, and –</p>

<p>Oh my goodness there was a selfie. It was <em>very</em> recent, and blurry – Phantom’s halo glow made his image smear on camera – but it was so close up to his face that Barry was sure he could see <em>acne </em>on Phantom’s face. Or were those freckles?  Barry didn’t know why anyone over 22 would post a picture of their face online if they weren’t an actor, and wondered if that <em>explained</em> some things about Phantom. </p><blockquote>

</p>

<p>There were memes galore on Phantom’s feed. As Barry scrolled through them, the image in Barry’s mind of Phantom being a malicious spirit was slowly being replaced by that of… a kid. A mischievous, powerful kid. It was so obvious in hindsight, even without his physical likeness to the younger Fenton kid. </p>

<p>Phantom probably spent every spare moment on the internet, like most kids do nowadays. It made Barry almost embarrassed for being afraid of Phantom, when the ghost kid was really just like any other kid. </p>

<p>There were a lot of tweets where Phantom answered people’s questions about recent events. Ghost attacks in their town. Who Flash was, and If Flash was a ghost. Well, Barry could clear that up himself. </p><blockquote>

<p>Wait. he forgot to reply to the person who asked the question, and he lost the tweet he wanted to reply to. It didn’t matter; people noticed he was online and his notifications climbed even higher. </p><blockquote>

<p>An epic rap battle video already? Barry watched the whole ten minute video. People in the comments section really thought he would <em>lose</em> to Phantom? He may have been scared of how powerful Phantom was before, but Phantom was just a <em>kid</em> and Barry was an <em>adult</em>, so obviously– </p>

<p>“Allen!” </p>

<p>The sound of Captain Singh’s voice interrupted Barry’s session of doomscrolling through the cursed blue bird app. </p>

<p>“Is the report done yet?” </p>

<p>–obviously he had to deal with his full time job and Phantom, a ghost, probably had more free time than most teenagers by virtue of being literally dead. He could see why the internet would think Phantom would win; he was most probably chronically online every moment he wasn’t fighting a ghost. </p>

<p>The captain was not pleased to find the forensic analyst goofing off at work. Barry was already constantly late to work and putting in odd hours – what, with his side gig as “The Flash”, who’s also worked directly with the police force a few times, even if they don’t know who he is under the mask – but Barry has always delivered good results, so the captain tolerated it. Barry sheepishly put his phone away. </p>

<p>“Almost, sir.” The chemical analysis he was waiting on had finished half an hour ago. </p>

<p>“Get to it, Allen. We need it by tomorrow,” </p>

<p>Barry muted his phone. That was enough internet for now.</p>
