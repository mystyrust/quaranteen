<p>When Danny left in the middle of his math class to fight Aragon in downtown Amity Park, he knew he was going to fail the next exam already. The semester was already half over, and Danny had a slew of assignments to catch up on and quizzes to retake. When his phone buzzed, he expected to get updates from Sam and Tucker about what he was currently missing at school; instead, he saw an unread message from his Twitter.</p>

<p>Danny dodged a blast of flames from behind, before responding. Cell phones weren’t allowed in school, technically, but he wasn’t in school right now.</p>

<p>Danny didn’t know how long his fight against Aragon would last. The Flash might not be able to help fight the dragon much, but if Danny could lure the ghost dragon outside of Amity Park, he most definitely would at least be able to reduce property damage. And then he could help The Flash fight his villain; maybe Barry was onto something.</p>

<p>The location pin was 2 hours out by car, but google maps didn’t provide directions for flying. As long as he was facing the correct direction and flying at top speed, Danny could get there much faster.</p>

<p>“Yo Ara<em>gone</em>,” Danny taunted. “For a dragon who rules over an entire kingdom, you’re pretty <em>weak</em>. And man, your kingdom is <em>small.</em>”</p>

<p>That set the dragon off. The ghost dragon honed in on Danny’s flying form, and let out an unintelligible howl, jumping off its perch to hunt its newest prey. It no longer paid attention to the civilians running away; it stopped attempting to perch or mold buildings to his liking.</p>

<p>The dragon was a fast flier. Danny was fast too, but Aragon – driven to baser emotions by the amulet around his neck – was just as fast, making up for the distance by firing a plume of flames in Danny’s direction. Danny wished <em>he</em> had fire breathing as part of his ghost powers, but he can’t have them all, apparently.</p>

<p>It could have been minutes or hours of flying and dodging flames – Danny didn’t check his phone – but buildings and residences faded away to highways, which eventually gave way to open grasslands, a common sight in the American midwest. Nowhere to hide, neither for Danny nor for Aragon. Aragon would have nowhere to hide from a Fenton thermos, but the ghost’s power levels were too high; Danny needed to weaken him first before the device could safely capture him.</p>

<p>Danny brought his phone out, but The Flash was already there, running in circles. This location was the perfect spot for the Flash to pull his tornado trick like he did in Amity Park, so Danny was surprised that the Flash <em>wasn’t </em>doing that, despite running circles. Almost like he was a little on the slow side.</p>

<p>The Flash ran towards them – huh, he <em>was</em> slower today – and Danny saw a thick layer of frost on one of Flash’s arms. Flash barely dodged a beam of ice that was fired from behind him, and Danny finally took a good look at the meta that Flash had asked Danny for help dealing with.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A parka’d man, who wore a pair of sunglasses. The sleeves of both arms were ripped out, encased in ice – one arm was raised, the same arm that shot an ice beam towards Flash. The meta fired the ice beam on the ground behind him, propelling himself to catch up to Flash.</p>

<p>“Captain Cold. Shoots ice from his hands,” Flash explained to Danny while panting.</p>

<p>Danny held his tongue about how lame the moniker was; he regularly fought against the Box Ghost, so it’s not like his rogues were any better.</p>

<p>This was an unusually good match up, Danny thought. Aragon’s fire breath could counter Captain Cold’s ice rays. Captain Cold’s ice rays could frost the dragon’s wings and down Aragon, making it easier for Danny to get the Amulet off him.</p>

<p>“Wait! Your hands! Lemme just –” Danny grabbed onto Flash and focused his intangibility onto himself and the meta-human. He kept the man and his suit, but clipped off the ice on his arms. The ice phased off of the Flash’s hand, fell off in a whole chunk, and crashed onto the floor. It was lucky that Flash wasn’t wearing his specter deflector, or Danny wouldn’t have been able to do that.</p>

<p>“Now. Please don’t freak out. But I’m gonna make us both invisibile so that they don’t see us.” Danny said. While still holding onto The Flash, he channeled more of his power, extending it to affect the human beside him.</p>

<p>Captain Cold, the more intelligent of the two pursuers, looked around for his suddenly missing target, staring at the spot Danny and Flash were last seen. Invisibility wasn’t a deterrent to another ghost, but the ghost dragon didn’t care. Aragon only noticed the newer <em>shinier </em>prey and the dragon fired its breath, the meta-human firing back with his own ice beam.</p>

<p>The two attacks met in the middle, fire pushing ice, ice pushing fire, each side vying for more power over the other. Danny and the Flash watched in silence.</p>

<p>Then, Cold turned one hand back and fired an ice beam angled downward, propelling himself out of the path of the fire breath. His free hand shot an ice beam at the nook of the dragon’s wing, and Aragon roared in pain, slowly descending downwards.</p>

<p>But as the dragon got closer to the ground, it lashed out with its tail, sending the meta-human flying outwards. Cold tried to slow and soften his landing with ice beams, but his touchdown was not smooth.</p>

<p>The meta-human got up again, firing even more powerful blasts of ice. The dragon dodged, taking flight before falling backdown thanks to the weight of the ice. Danny and Barry could feel the shockwaves of the falling dragon’s impact ripple through them, ghostly intangibility preventing it from knocking them over and out.</p>

<p>The ghost dragon finally realized it could also turn intangible, and did so to clip the ice out of its wings. The ice beams went right through the dragon, dissipating aimlessly in the sky. Thank goodness this battle wasn’t in a heavily populated area; the property damage would’ve been <em>intense.</em></p>

<p>“Does his ice ever run out?” Danny whispered.</p>

<p>“No clue,” Flash whispered back.</p>

<p>Captain Cold kept firing ice beam after ice beam, ineffectice against the intangible dragon, but the battle shifted ever so slightly when Aragon turned tangible to blow his fire breath – the ice connected first, but the ghost fire reached its intended target. The meta-human blocked the brunt of the fire with his right hand, most of the ice melting off. The dragon took the opportunity to tail slam the meta-human, who crashed painfully into a tree trunk.</p>

<p>Cold got up, and fired an ice beam from his left hand, other hand hanging limp to his right. Ice beam frosted the dragon’s snout, who retaliated with a swipe at the meta-human with its claw.</p>

<p>“I’ll catch him,” Danny said to Flash, dropping the invisibility and intangibility. “Get the amulet off the dragon’s neck if you can!”</p>

<p> </p><hr />

<p> </p>

<p>Barry took a moment to freak out as he saw and <em>felt</em> himself returning to the visible spectrum, mass seemingly returning to his body. He wondered how it felt for the ghosts, since the dragon was sometimes intangible and sometimes solid enough to land powerful hits. And it breathed fire.</p>

<p>He watched as Phantom caught the prone form of Captain Cold, and noticed that the tiny ghost held the grown adult in bridal style, gently setting the man down. So the ghost had super strength, too; check.</p>

<p>Barry – now faster without the ice weighing down his arm and lowering his body temperature – ran along the dragon's back at super speed, climbing up its spine until he reached the neck. He wasn’t sure how it was physically possible that he was running up the body of a <em>ghost</em>, but he didn’t have time to think too hard about it. The dragon was dazed thanks to the blow of ice on his snout. Barry didn’t think Captain Cold’s attacks would work against the ghost, but was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Maybe Phantom knew something about it.</p>

<p>He ripped the amulet off the back, and jumped down the side. The dragon shrunk into the form of a renaissance faire man, wearing robes, crown, and staff that Barry reasoned would most likely be period accurate.</p>

<p>Barry ran over to Phantom, handing the ghost the amulet.</p>

<p>“Here, you’re the one with the thermos, and Captain Cold is my problem, so let’s swap back.”</p>

<p>Barry whipped out a pair of meta-human cuffs from his belt, and slapped it onto the meta-human's non-frosted hands, restraining him from behind. The meta-human cuffs, now perfected after testing them on Barry and workshopping its schematics with the Fentons, would ensure that Captain Cold would not be able to call on his meta-human abilities. Though, the meta-human probably wouldn’t, even without the cuffs – the man was bruised in many places, most likely concussed, and half conscious.</p>

<p>“Heh, the yellow one didn’t tell me there’d be a dragon and a flying kiiiiid,” Cold slurred.</p>

<p>“...the yellow one?” Barry asked.</p>

<p>“Really fast. Like you. Like a bee. Stings like a bee. Floats like a butterfly.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t making any sense; Barry should ask again when Captain Cold would be more lucid.</p>

<p> </p><hr />

<p> </p>

<p>“Ugh… what was I…?” The humanoid form of Prince Aragon came to, looking confused, then alarmed after seeing a thermos pointed in his direction.</p>

<p>“That’s what I wanted to ask you, Aragon,” Danny bristled. “We had an agreement. You were to never use the amulet, if I gave it back to you. So why did you –?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A ghost I’d never seen before asked me for a favor. Then everything was murky and I woke up here.”</p>

<p>Ghosts rarely asked others for favors – they preferred to work alone. Maybe it was a ghost Danny had never met before.</p>

<p>“What was the favor? And what did the ghost look like? Did you catch his name or anything?”</p>

<p>Prince Aragon, while arrogant and a prick, was never one to leave his precious little kingdom in the ghost zone without a ruler. It was his lair. Danny figured his attack in Amity Park was not only out of character, but potentially… an orchestration. Either against Aragon’s kingdom or against Amity Park.</p>

<p>“A purple cloak. That’s all I remember. Not even the favor itself.”</p>

<p>Danny sighed.</p>

<p>“Look, we’ll talk more later. In the meantime: sorry for the cramped Uber.” And he sucked up the prince into the Fenton Thermos.</p>

<p>Danny then flew over to Flash, checking if the speedster needed help apprehending his own villain.</p>

<p>“The press is gonna have a field day with this,” Danny said, remembering the gossip among his classmates. A helicopter’s whirring blades could be heard in the distance.</p>

<p>Flash knew the press didn’t always get everything, or even everything <em>right</em> – his first ever, five-second appearance in Amity Park was picked up by the news, but no one knew the details of their encounter.</p>

<p>“We should team up, for real, sometime,” Flash told Danny. “We kinda just… hung around while they knocked each other out.”</p>

<p>What would a future, ‘real’ team up even <em>mean</em>? Fighting bad guys together? Was it adult code for ‘handing out’?</p>

<p>Danny wasn’t willing to be Flash’s ‘on-call’ sidekick, he was way too… busy. Danny would be busy fighting ghosts, while Flash would be busy catching meta-human criminals and stopping crime in his city. Not to mention how much school he was <em>already</em> missing…</p>

<p>As much as Danny would love to team up with the Flash, did they need to have a villain to fight every single time? Today’s was an unusually good matchup, but how often would that always happen?</p>

<p>“Fine, but only on weekends.” Danny responded. If a ghost happened to appear in the short time he spent away from Amity Park, maybe The Red Huntress could take care of it.</p>

<p>“But what if –”</p>

<p>“Listen, you’re lucky I was already out flying, Flash. I might not be able to help with villains all the time.”</p>

<p>“...Okay, fine.” Flash conceded. Even if Danny didn’t understand what or how they would ‘team up’, Danny couldn’t deny that he wanted to. He <em>did</em> want to meet The Flash more often; it was rare to meet another “enhanced” person who was protecting his own town, and Danny wanted to do his best to slowly undo that bad first impression for Flash.</p>

<p>“Maybe we could train together?” Danny offered.</p>

<p><em>That</em> seemed to pique Flash’s interest – Phantom was more experienced of the two, but Danny wasn’t sure how much he could necessarily impart on the older, less experienced hero.</p>

<p>“Since you already know who I am, you should come to StarLabs,” Flash said. “Meet the rest of the crew!</p>

<p>“I thought you worked at – uh, nevermind,”</p>

<p>Danny knew from Sam’s internet research that ‘Barry Allen’ worked at CCPD, so he was confused where and how ‘StarLabs’ fit into the picture.</p>

<p>“My friends would love to meet a real live ghost!” Flash chuckled. “Though ‘live ghost’ is a bit of an oxymoron.”</p>

<p>“You’re a moron,” Danny responded without missing a beat.</p>

<p>Flash laughed, but he got the impression that Phantom was slightly insulted by the word.</p>

<p>“N-No you see, an oxymoron is a phrase that kinda contradicts itself, like ‘live ghost’ –”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> what that means,” Danny interrupted. “I’ve taken English before.” The battle had dragged on and he was missing English class right now. His whole existence was an oxymoron.</p>

<p> </p><hr />

<p> </p>

<p>Barry dropped off the restrained Captain Cold to Iron Heights – law enforcement was given clear instructions for how to operate the meta-human cuffs and how they worked, so it was now possible to detain meta-human criminals, in the highest security division at least. Iron Heights had plans to open a meta-human wing in the future as well.</p>

<p>The StarLabs crew had wanted to ‘invite’ Phantom over – they’ve discussed as much many times – and Barry’s actions finally made it possible. While Barry was wary at first, he warmed up to the idea after his second trip to Amity Park with Cisco; Dr. Wells was still opposed.</p>

<p>“Think about it!” Barry said. “We get to learn more about ghosts, we get to learn more about <em>him</em>, and maybe even try to figure out who he is!”</p>

<p>“Barry, he knows who you and Cisco are,” Dr. Wells pointed out. “He doesn’t know who Caitlyn and I are. Phantom knowing who the core members of Team Flash are could be dangerous. He’s powerful.”</p>

<p><em>Joe</em> also knew who the core members of Team Flash were, and Dr. Wells had no problem with that, Barry wanted to say. He was a member of law enforcement. Just because Joe wasn’t a powerful meta-human didn’t mean he wasn’t powerful.</p>

<p>“He’s also a kid – whether he’s a dead ghost or a living meta,” Caitlyn pointed out. “And even if he’s powerful, then he could help us just as much as we help him. Maybe even more!” Caitlyn really wanted to take biometric scans, take x-rays, run a stress test – if that was even <em>possible.</em></p>

<p>“You think he might know anything about who sent Captain Cold?” Cisco asked. “That bit he said about ‘floating like a butterfly’ sounded like it could be a ghost, you know?”</p>

<p>“Good point. Captain Cold was too out of it to explain to me when I asked.”</p>

<p>“I guess you could say he was ‘out cold’, hah,”</p>

<p>“But if it <em>were</em> a ghost, wouldn’t they have stayed in Amity Park? And if they didn’t, Phantom would know?” Dr. Wells said.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s a limitation of his ability as a ghost? Not knowing every single ghost that escaped? And we know what the Fentons think of him, but maybe we could finally find out what <em>he</em> thinks about the Fentons and their research?”</p>

<p>Dr. Wells sighed. There was no changing these kids’ minds about their playdate with the ghost boy.</p>

<p> </p><hr />

<p> </p>

<p>The informational news article, the one that Barry went with Iris to Amity Park for, didn’t tell much information. Wells could count on his one hand how many times the word ‘ghost’ was used, and all it really told him was how much about Phantom was truly unknown. He knew it would be too much to find the ghost boy’s strengths and weaknesses published in an article meant to be read by the public, but reading about the meta-boy helping people who did not appreciate his help meant nothing for Wells.</p>

<p>Not meta-boy; ghost boy – Barry’s visits confirmed that ghosts were real, but Wells still had a hard time believing it. If Wells had his way, Barry would have never visited Amity Park. Wells could guide and mold The Flash in the way he saw proper, have Barry depend on him for learning how to use his speed. For a while, things seemed to go on track, Barry seemed uncomfortable whenever conversation shifted to Amity Park for some time, and kept his focus on Central City.</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Percent likelihood that Flash’s speed training will falter: 34%</em>
</p>

<p>Then he visited again with Cisco, and some of Barry’s anxieties had lifted.</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Percent likelihood that Flash’s speed training will falter: 47%</em>
</p>

<p>So Wells decided to send a meta-human villain after Barry that could effectively counter his speed. Captain Cold was meant to inspire the fear of death in Barry, to make him realize how fallible he can be even if fast. He needs to train to be faster. And Wells would be the one to help him train.</p>

<p>Then Phantom appeared, and the meta-human was defeated without <em>any </em>use of Barry’s speed.</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Percent likelihood that Flash’s speed training will falter: 59%</em>
</p>

<p>Then Barry decided to invite Phantom over to visit StarLabs.</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Percent likelihood that Flash’s speed training will falter: ??%</em>
</p>

<p>“Gideon, you know I hate working in theoreticals. Give me absolutes. Quantify for me, what type of threat is Phantom to <em>my plan</em>? Will this delay The Flash’s speed timeline?”</p>

<p>Gideon ran silent calculations at super speed.</p>

<p>Wells needed to harness as much speed from The Flash as possible, to fuel his return to the future, to his timeline. In doing so, he accelerated Barry’s transformation into The Flash by 7 years – but even if he manipulated the events, if he controlled enough variables he could still achieve the results he wanted. Phantom was a variable that the time traveler <em>couldn’t</em> control, and that irritated him. The more that Flash’s speed training faltered, the more deviated history would become.</p>

<p>“Inconclusive.”</p>

<p>“<em>Why?!”</em></p>

<p>“The ghost dragon that appeared today was not anticipated, and could not be predicted. Most of Phantom’s enemies are not documented in the temporal news archives, or their documentation is too sparse.”</p>

<p>Wells huffed. With Phantom’s upcoming visit, maybe he could gather more raw data for Gideon, to make better predictions. Not necessarily about Phantom’s rogue gallery, but maybe about Phantom himself. Phantom was a variable that the time traveler would <em>learn</em> to control, no matter what.</p>
