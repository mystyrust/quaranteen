    <p>...i meant to write phantom angst and i accidentally wrote hawkmoth angst... 
        <br/> this is the end of the fic! comments and kudos are now open and waiting for you!
        <br /><br />
        this is my final fic for dp crossover angst week! it was a blast! give the other fics from this event a read! (reblogged on the <a href="https://dp-crossover-angst-week-event.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>)
        <br />i think theres something deeply funny about the fact that 4 out of 5 of the fics i wrote for this event are explicitly tagged with "identity reveal". its like i just have 1 setting lol
        <br /><br />
        not sure if or when ill ever revisit this au, but it defo has a lot of potential 
        <br/><br/>
        All css and html up on <a href="https://github.com/mystyrust/quaranteen/tree/master/MLB-DP">github</a>! 
        <br />check out my other <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works?commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=html+tryhard&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&user_id=mystyrust">HTML Tryhard</a> fics, and checkout other <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/HTML%20Tryhard">html tryhard fics on ao3</a> :))
        <br /><br />
        also! if you want to re-read this fic as one long piece of text without having to go through all that clicking (and get to the comments), click the "==>" string from the notes that were in the beginning of this fic (inside the "click me" segment) for a toggle shortcut :))

 The red gem on your staff let's you command and control ghosts. You never believed it could, until you acquired a ghost to test it out on. Unfortunately, this ghost has the potty humor of a crass teenager.
