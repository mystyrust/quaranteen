<p>You stretch your staff, the red gem atop it glowing red. </p>

<div class="steps-result step1">
<p><u>“Get me the coffee from the table” ==></u></p>

<p>The glowing boy with white hair and a black jumpsuit got the coffee from your table and gave it to you. You didn’t think that would actually work, but it did. His eyes glow red, the same red as your staff. </p>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step2"><summary><p><u>“Do 30 Jumping Jacks” ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step2">
<p><u>“Do 30 Jumping Jacks” ==></u></p>

<p>The boy immediately starts the exercise in place. You watch him do each one – and when he hits thirty, he stops. </p>

<p>So, complicated tasks that require mental awareness are possible. You expected as much.</p>

<p>His eyes are still red, body idle but waiting for your next command. </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step3"><summary><p><u>“Run 10 laps around the room” ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step3">

<p><u>“Run 10 laps around the room” ==></u></p>

<p>The boy grumbles, but complies to your order. </p>

<p>Interesting that it’s capable of displaying dissent, you think. </p>

<p>That makes sense. When you found that old, dilapidated thermos and opened it up, you expected a ghost to come out, so you were confused when a boy seemed to “form” instead. The ghost’s body was hardly stable, turning into green liquid at first before congealing into the form of a sleeping boy. He woke up confused and disoriented, yet was able to communicate clearly in English. </p>

<p>But you weren’t fooled by his appearance – you knew he was a ghost. </p>

<p>You hadn’t wasted any time using the red gem on your staff to be sure, and you were proven right. Your staff only lets you control ghosts, but it worked on controlling this boy. Therefore, this boy must be a ghost, you concluded. </p>

<p>You <em>did</em> know about the alleged power of the red gem on your staff – even if you didn’t believe in ghosts, you always researched all about mystics and occult tools from across cultures. This ghost thermos – which was one of the latest finds from the Paris catacombs exhibit you went to earlier today – was the perfect way to test out your mind controlling staff. Even if it wouldn’t have worked out, you figured you could run away, hide, and let Ladybug clean up any resulting mess. </p>

<p>You mentally pat yourself on the back for the wisdom you had to install the mind controlling gem into your staff that you carry with you everywhere – your foresight paid off. </p>

<p>[LOL what an egomaniac.]</p>

<p>“Who said that?” You say out loud cautiously. You spin around, looking for the source of the voice. It’s just you and the ghost boy running laps in the room. </p>

<p>[You look like you’ve seen a ghost]</p>

<p>The ghost boy’s face is blank.</p>

<p>[Are you the ghost boy?] You think while staring at the figure running around the room.</p>

<p>[You can hear me? Wow, didn't expect that.]</p>

<p>So, this isn’t mind control at <em>all</em>. That’s not what the ancient texts about your gem said. Then again, ghost experts like the Fentons claimed that ghosts didn’t have much mental capabilities, and yet –</p>

<p>Well, it might not matter. </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step4"><summary><p><u>[Do a handstand] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step4">
<p><u>[Do a handstand] ==></u></p>

<p>[Uhhh no than– oh crap]</p>

<p>The boy stopped his cartwheel halfway, his legs in the air and his hands on the floor. </p>

<p>You delivered that command mentally, instead of verbally, and the command still worked. </p>

<p>Oh, this would be <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>[Yikes]</p>

<p>You read in another rare book that ghosts are capable of invisibility, intangibility, flight, and even possession. An evil – no, a <em>genius</em> thought crossed your mind.</p>

<p>[Whatever you’re thinking, I don’t like it]</p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step5"><summary><p><u>[Turn invisible and follow me] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step5">
<p><u>[Turn invisible and follow me] ==></u></p>

<p>You go downstairs and get into your limo. You instruct your driver to take you to the Le Grand Paris Hotel – you have a business meeting there with another fashion mogul. </p>

<p>Without the visual feedback, you realize you’re not sure if the boy actually followed you. Did he escape? </p>

</div>
<details class="fic-steps step6"><summary><p><u>[Say a joke out loud] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step6">
<p><u>[Say a joke out loud] ==></u></p>

<p>“A joke” a disembodied voice said. “Hey Mr. Driver! There’s a ghost in your car!”</p>

<p>Your well trained driver is unphased. </p>

</div>

<details class="fic-steps step7"><summary><p><u>“Shut up” ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step7">
<p><u>“Shut up” ==></u> </p>

<p>[Where are we going?] The ghost asked mentally. [What are you planning?]</p>

<p>He stops talking outloud but he keeps talking <em>mentally</em>. There’s a bit of a leeway between talking and thinking, you guess. </p>

<p>[You’ll see], you telegraph back.</p>

<p>You exit the limo, and walk up to the conference room that was booked earlier in your name. </p>

<p>You and a business fellow were meant to discuss and sign contracts detailing stock shares, shipping rates, and product placements. Quite frankly, your business “fellow” was trying to overcharge you. You were willing to go along with his terms, but what if you could set your own?</p>

<p>You presented your counter offer, with a contract already written up. Your business fellow scrunched his nose up in thought, mostly displeased with what he saw on the paper.</p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step8"><summary><p><u>[Possess him, and make him sign the contract] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step8">
<p><u>[Possess him, and make him sign the contract] ==></u></p>

<p>[hey man wtf]</p>

<p>The ghost boy complained, but you could see the moment that the body of your business partner was possessed – a jerk, followed by glowing red eyes, and then the paper was signed without protest. </p>

<p>“I’m glad we could come to an agreement,” You said as you exited the conference room. </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step9"><summary><p><u>[Follow me out, keep invisible] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step9">
<p><u>[Follow me out, keep invisible] ==></u></p>

<p>Presumably the ghost boy followed you as you left the conference room and sat back in your limo. </p>

<p>[<em>So</em> not cool] the ghost boy protested. Ah, there he was. </p>

<p>You realize it would be annoying to dictate the ghost boy’s location and actions every single time.</p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step10"><summary><p><u>[Stay within a 5 meter radius of me at all times] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step10">
<p><u>[Stay within a 5 meter radius of me at all times] ==></u></p>

<p>You wonder if perpetual commands will work the same as one-time incidental commands. </p>

<p>[Does this order include the bathroom?]</p>

<p>You sigh. </p>

<p>Teenage boys and their <em>immaturity</em>. </p>

<p>[Also, I’m American. Can you convert that to feet for me?]</p>

<p>At least your son would never talk back to you so crassly. He’s not as obedient as the ghost boy under your puppet-like control, but at least your son is respectful to you.</p>

<p>[I can’t follow your order if I don’t know how much you actually mean.] the ghost boy teased. </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step11"><summary><p><u>[Fine. Stay within 15 <strong>feet</strong> of me at all times, you petulant brat] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step11">
<p><u>[Fine. Stay within 15 <strong>feet</strong> of me at all times, you petulant brat] ==></u></p>

<p>This was infuriating. At least when you command Akumatized targets to get Ladybug and Cat Noir’s Miraculouses for you, you don’t have to spell it out for them. They know to target the earrings and ring, even if they fail every single time.  </p>

<p>With this ghost boy, you can issue commands in broad daylight, without needing to resort to your Miraculous – but your commands have to be more exact, and he talks back all the time.</p>

<p>You are used to working with american fashion designers, so you approximated the math. 5 feet and 5 meters were vastly different distances.</p>

<p>This gem on your staff is interesting. It’s the one that lets you control the ghost boy like this. The ghost boy can fly, turn invisible, go through walls -- maybe there’s more to this power than you realize. Does he have a kwami?</p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step12"><summary><p><u>[Who is your kwami?] ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step12">
<p><u>[Who is your kwami?] ==></u></p>

<p>[I’m not telling you.] The ghost boy pouts. </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step13"><summary><p><u>“<strong>Tell me</strong> who your kwami is. <strong>Tell me</strong> where your miraculous is” ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step13">
<p><u>“<strong>Tell me</strong> who your kwami is. <strong>Tell me</strong> where your miraculous is” ==></u></p>

<p>[No.]</p>

<p>You listen as carefully as you can – but he doesn’t accidentally <em>think</em> the answer either. </p>

<p>It’s rare, but sometimes Akuma’s fight off their possession. Maybe he’s fighting the control of your gem staff? </p>

<p>Maybe you need to explain it to him. </p>

<p>[A kwami is a magical creature that resides in a Miraculous that– ]</p>

<p>[I do know what a kwami is, and I’m not telling you.] the boy snaps back. </p>

<p>Interesting. The thermos that the ghost boy was held in must be nearly fifty years old. It was unearthed recently and shared in the newest exhibit sharing the latest finds from the Paris Catacombs, which you were able to acquire for a more private examination. </p>

<p>The Miraculous haven’t been seen in Paris for at least a century, until you unearthed the Butterfly and Peacock Miraculous a year ago. This ghost boy has a mystical history with the source of the Miraculous, one that possibly transcends space and time. You wonder if he <em>is </em>a kwami. Maybe an incomplete one. </p>

<p>Either way, your ability to control him gave you a new idea.</p>

<p>Today would be the day you achieve victory over Ladybug, at last. </p>

<p>You exit the limo and enter your home. Your faithful assistant Nathalie greets you at the door. </p>

<p>“You’re back early, Gabriel, sir.” She says in mild surprise. “I hope your meeting went well. Adrien is back from school and asked me if –” </p>

<p>“Cancel all my afternoon appointments, Nathalie. I’ll be busy this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“But–”</p>

<p>“If this goes well, I’ll have a lot more free time to spend with Adrien, very soon.” You tell her cryptically. She understands and stops questioning you. You feel proud of how well you’ve trained your employees.</p>

<p>[Control Freak.]</p>

<p>You ignore the ghost boy as you enter the code on the wall to open the hidden corridor to your secret Atrium, and ascend. </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step14"><summary><p><u>“Whenever we are in this room, stay visible” ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step14">

<p><u>“Whenever we are in this room, stay visible” ==></u></p>

<p>The ghost boy popped into view. Giving out commands into the void felt a lot like controlling an Akuma is like, you think. </p>

<p>The visibility would be short lived though, as you continue to the next phase of your plan.</p>

<p>“Nooroo, Dark Wings Rise!” </p>

<p>You use your Miraculous to transform into your private alter ego, Hawkmoth. </p>

<p>You need to create an Akuma that’s challenging enough to distract Ladybug. Hm. You spot a kid who’s annoyed that no one laughs at his jokes and pranks. It seemed he was always annoyed at being one second too late for the pay off of his jokes, so you grant him portal powers so that he can always be at the exact time and place he wants for the perfect prank. You name him Perfect Prankster and send him on his way. </p>

<p>The ghost boy begins to mentally laugh. </p>

<p>“What’s so funny?” you ask with a glare.</p>

<p>[Do I just have to explain it mentally, or do I get to laugh too?]</p>

<p>You sigh. </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step15"><summary><p><u>“You may speak out loud, but only in this room.” ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step15">
<p><u>“You may speak out loud, but only in this room.” ==></u></p>

<p>The boy's eyes are still red, body under your command, but he regains control of his facial muscles. </p>

<p>“I think I’m an even better Prankster than the Akuma you just made,” he says with a breathless laugh.</p>

<p>You turn your attention to the battle. Thanks to your psychic connection with Perfect Prankster, you can see the battle and hear the battle through his eyes. You can see him fighting Ladybug, Cat Noir, and a third Miraculous user. You squint your eyes to strengthen the connection. The third user’s costume looks too simple to be a Miraculous user – black suit, white hair… <em>no</em>, it <em>couldn’t be.</em></p>

<p>You whip your head back – the ghost boy is still there by your side. Yet, there he was, fighting alongside Ladybug and Cat Noir against you. How was he doing this, being at two places at once? </p>
</div>

<details class="fic-steps step16"><summary><p><u>“Are you a kwami? Are you a sentimonster?” ==></u></p></summary></details>

<div class="steps-result step17">
<p><u>“<strong>Tell</strong> me what you are.” ==></u></p>

<p>“If you <em>must</em> know, my name’s Phantom.”</p>

<p>This tells you <em>absolutely nothing</em>. An uncreative name, for a creature you believed to be a ghost at first but could be something more. </p>

<p>“Besides, I thought you <em>knew</em> I was a ghost,”</p>

<p>You decide it doesn’t matter <em>what</em> he is because he can still be controlled by your red gem. </p>

<p>You turn your attention back to the battle, and notice that the other Phantom disappeared at some point, and that Perfect Prankster was about to be de-akumatized. </p>

<p>You had a narrow window, between which Ladybug would use her Miraculous to reset the damage, and her detransformation countdown would begin. </p>
</div>
<details class="fic-steps step18"><summary><p><u>“<strong>Possess</strong> Ladybug. <strong>Remove</strong> her Miraculous and bring it to me.” ==></u></p></summary></details>
<div class="steps-result step18">
<p><u>“<strong>Possess</strong> Ladybug. <strong>Remove</strong> her Miraculous and bring it to me.” ==></u></p>

<p>[Oh fuck.]</p>

<p>Normally, you can’t Akumatize her, but this roundabout way would still give you Ladybug’s Miraculous – <em>and</em> her identity.</p>

<p>The ghost boy flew out the atrium, turning invisible on his way out, and heading towards Ladybug and Cat Noir. </p>

<p>You note how you didn’t have to explain to him exactly where Ladybug and Cat Noir were fighting. Maybe your command was simply strong enough to supersede any loopholes that Phantom was dancing around.</p>

<p>You watch as Phantom possesses Ladybug, and a psychic struggle ensues. </p>

<p>You spy on them using your red-gem psychic connection with Phantom. </p>

<p>[L̴a̵d̷y̶b̷u̸g̸, I am Phantom! Tie your hands!]</p>

<p>This seemed to snap the girl into surprise, and she yelled something at Cat Noir. </p>

<p>Oh, Phantom <em>knew</em> Ladybug, underneath the earrings. </p>

<p>Cat Noir maneuvered a pair of black and red spotted handcuffs behind Ladybug’s back. </p>

<p>You grin with a smirk. The power of the kwami that protects Ladybug’s identity from bad actors protects yours too. You hear the beeping of Ladybug’s earrings. Now it’s just a waiting game before you find out Ladybug’s identity eventually. </p>

<p>[Hawkmoth lives at that fancy pants mansion that Adrien lives at!]</p>

<p>“Gabriel Agreste?” Ladybug says out loud. “Is Hawkmoth?” </p>

<p>[Yes!]</p>

<p>Right, this ghost boy was a menace when it came to finding <em>loopholes</em>. </p>

<p>“But, wait, if Gabriel Agreste is Hawkmoth,” Ladybug says carefully, “wouldn’t his son Adrien know?” </p>

<p>Now that the identity was revealed, the protection power on his name was gone. </p>

<p>“No,” Cat Noir says. “He wouldn’t. I think he’d be heartbroken if he knew,” </p>

<p>You cut your body control over Phantom and run out of the Atrium, trying to buy yourself a head start before anyone else figures out what you’re planning to do next. Your identity has been compromised. You need to leave. </p>

<p>You don’t even bother to detransform, heading down to Nathalie’s office. </p>

<p>“Nathalie! Grab the away-bags! We are executing Protocol H!” </p>

<p>“Gabriel, sir! I’ll grab Adrien!” </p>

<p>“No need, I’ll do it!” </p>

<p>You need your son to see you as Hawkmoth first, before Ladybug poisons his mind with any lies. You need to control the narrative, so that your son understands, you did this <em>for him</em>. </p>

<p>Then, he and you can run away from Paris and try to get the Ladybug and Cat Miraculous again, when the bad publicity dies down. </p>

<p>Maybe you can even work together. It would be nice to be able to share this part of your life with your son, you think.</p>

<p>You slam open the door to his room, expecting to see Adrien doing his homework like he’s supposed to be. Instead, you see something far worse.</p>

<p>Ladybug and Cat Noir are in your son’s bedroom. And so is that Not-Kwami, who calls himself Phantom. But your son is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Where is Adrien?! What have you done with my son?!” You screech angrily. </p>

<p>Ladybug has resolution written all over her face, but Cat Noir has tears threatening to bubble over.</p>

<p>“Why did you do it, Father?” </p>

<p>Cat Noir wipes the tears that fall down his cheek.</p>

<p>“Why are you Hawkmoth?” </p>

<p>You can’t believe your ears. Your enemy couldn’t possibly be your own son.</p>

<p>“Plagg, Claws In,” </p>

<p>Ladybug and Phantom flinch in surprise, but Cat Noir – no, <em>Adrien </em>– remains still. </p>

<p>Maybe, maybe this can still work. Half the work is done for you. </p>

<p>“I, I do it for you, son,” </p>

<p>Maybe you can still prove to him that you have his best interests at heart. Maybe you two can work together to get Ladybug’s Miraculous, just like you were thinking about earlier. </p>

<p>“With the two Miraculous, we can bring back your mother,” You say.</p>

<p>You watch his head and eyes flinch in surprise.</p>

<p>“If you give me your Miraculous, and convince your friend to give me hers, we can fix everything for everyone!” </p>

<p>“That’s not how it works, Adrien! Someone who’s dead can’t be brought back to life, not even with the Miraculous of Creation!” </p>

<p>But you can see your words have some effect on Adrien. He was your son before he was Cat Noir, after all. </p>

<p>He wavers. </p>

<p>“What happens when you <em>do</em> bring her back?” He asks cautiously. “You can’t do something like that without a price,” </p>

<p>“She’ll take some time to recover, but she’ll be <em>back</em>,” You give vague promises. The truth is, you <em>don’t</em> <em>know</em> what’ll happen when she returns, you <em>don’t know</em> the price, but you’re willing to pay whatever it is.</p>

<p>“Do you think she can re-enter society after being dead and absent?” Ladybug challenges. “Or, will she have to remain hidden for the rest of her resurrected life? Is that a life worth living?” Adrien flinches at that thought. </p>

<p>You grumble, and clench your staff. Your palm covers the red gem. </p>

<p>Was that… a Kwami-less transformation? That couldn’t <em>possibly</em> exist, that boy called himself a ghost. Unless ‘Phantom’ was the name of his kwami? Or his kwami was a ghost? Or –?</p>
