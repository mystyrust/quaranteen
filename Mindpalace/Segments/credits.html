<p class="prenotes-text"><span>hi yall, please keep creators style on -- this work uses a custom work skin, and while it reads best in the default light mode, it <em>should</em> also be compatible with reversi, and most common ao3 site skins. 
<br /><br />if not, please let me know in the comments if something is weird in a different site skin. 
<br /><br />anyway, this work requires you to click a few buttons to progress (hopefully its obvious which buttons those are), but no crazy interactions are required. </span></p>
