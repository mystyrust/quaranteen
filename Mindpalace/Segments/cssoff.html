<p>“Alright,” Izuku said. “I’m here now, guys. Where should I look?” </p>
<p>Izuku was addressing the vestiges, but they were silent. A side effect of turning off the “creator’s style”, perhaps. </p>
<p>Everything looked the same as far as he could tell: same cafeteria, same benches, same notebook in–</p>
<p>“Ah! You’re here!” </p>
<p>It was as if the writer had never moved from her spot, and she was just sitting there invisibly the entire time, watching Izuku.</p>
<p>“How are you seeing me?!” She exclaimed. “Did you… turn the CSS <em>off</em>?” </p>
<p>“I… think so?” Izuku responded. Why was that such a big deal? </p>
<p>“Hmph, this takes ‘characters deciding their own plot’ to a whole new level. Why are you even here? To tell me what a bad writer I am?” The girl threw her notebook across the room. “Well, you don’t have to, I already know!” </p>
<p>“No!” Izuku exclaimed. “I wanted to apologize for that,” </p>
<p>She glared silently.</p>
<p>Whether he was ‘real’ or not, or she was ‘real’ or not, the girl was hurt – and that was real enough to matter.</p>
<p>“I mean, you’re not that writer anymore, it’s okay that you were bad once, and you’re better now –”</p>
<p>“I notice that you’re not <em>actually</em> saying sorry for calling my old stuff bad,”</p>
<p>“– because we all start somewhere,” Izuku sighed as he continued. “I was terrible at using my quirk when I first inherited it. Even All Might thought so.”</p>
<p>He looked down at the palm of his hands, calluses and scars covering them both. A far cry from the smooth skin he used to have, before he got a quirk.</p>
<p>“I’d never be an expert today, if I quit as a rookie yesterday.” Izuku said. “You’ve read my story, you know how it goes, right?” </p>
<p><em>That </em>seemed to capture her attention. </p>
<p>“The blood sweat and tears from grueling hours of training, the mocking of my peers – how a person like me, who wasn’t born with a quirk, could never make it into UA. As much as I wanted to get into UA for myself, because it was my dream, I wanted to get in to also prove the haters wrong.”  </p>
<p>Izuku knew what it felt like being ridiculed for what others considered an ‘impossible’ dream. He walked over to where the thrown notebook lay, picking it up delicately and making sure none of the pages were bent or ripped when he closed it. </p>
<p>“You’re already getting better at it, if the fact that you were able to affect my reality means anything at all.” Izuku said. “So, if writing is something you want to get better at, don’t quit. The pen is mightier than the sword, just be careful not to turn it towards yourself.” </p>
<p>He handed the notebook back to its owner, the writer. </p>
<p>“Some blunt sword my pen is,” She grumbled. </p>
<p>“It might seem like that now, but once you get good enough at writing, maybe you could write us a world without villains, without crime, and without poverty,” Izuku mused. “A blunt sword is great against someone holding a twig, and most of us don’t hold anything of that sort on us.” Izuku felt like the analogy was falling apart a little, but he tried his best.</p>
<p>She took the notebook from his hand.</p>
<p>“Would anyone ‘suspend disbelief’ for a story with that type of perfect setting?” she said. “No conflict, no evil? Besides, does that mean everything I write, good AND bad, would affect reality? Your reality? Because I wouldn’t mind good effects, but I wouldn’t want bad ones. Doesn’t that mean I should still stop writing?” </p>
<p>“I have another theory why your writing affected reality – you’re in it, and I read it. That creates a paradox that would have never existed if you had never traveled outside your world.” Izuku mumbled. “Besides, how did you get here in the first place?”</p>
<p>“I don’t entirely remember… but I noticed that a character based on my appearance was in my drafts – my ‘self insert’ technically – and maybe that has something to do with why I’m here, when I shouldn’t be?” </p>
<p>“What if…” Izuku didn’t like this idea, but he had to say it. “What if you wrote yourself out of your drafts?” </p>
<p>“Huh?” the girl panicked. </p>
<p>“I don’t mean killing the character off! I mean just… removing mentions of yourself from your latest draft. That would naturally slot you out of the narrative when it plays out in reality,… right? That way, you can continue writing about us or… whatever you want, and it won’t affect this reality if you’re not in it anymore, right?” </p>
<p>“So I can never write RPF? Or project myself into the characters I write?” The girl asked. Her question wasn’t with malice, but a curiosity of what her words can and can’t – or, shouldn’t – do. </p>
<p>“I… don’t think that’s entirely true. Autobiographies and memoirs exist. Newspapers and Textbooks exist.” Izuku thought out loud. “Besides, some type of inspiration is always taken from reality – or other fiction. No one exists in a vacuum…” </p>
<p>“But my power won’t affect <em>my own</em> reality?” </p>
<p>“I don’t know – I <em>wouldn’t</em> know. But no quirk – or power – is ever <em>evil</em>, it’s only the user. All quirks should be honed and practiced, and then harnessed for the greater good.” Izuku smiled. “And if your power <em>does</em> affect your reality, well, I bet you can do so much good with it.” </p>
<p>Izuku wondered if the face he made when looking at his hero analysis notes was the same look the writer had on her face, looking at her own notebook.</p>
<p>“That… okay, that kind of makes sense, I think,” The girl responded. “I need to find a way to practice writing without it affecting reality. But… when I fix my draft and remove myself from it, will <em>you</em>remember any of this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Izuku admitted. “The vestiges might? Those voices, I mean. But I wouldn’t count on it, they haven’t always been present.”</p>
<p>(that’s so rude, we’re right here.) (a little bare bones but we made it too!)</p>
<p>Izuku and the girl laughed. </p>
<p>“Besides, if you remember my advice, and keep practicing, I think that’s good enough for me,” </p>
<p>(He’s right! You don’t become an expert overnight!) </p>
<p>The girl tucked her laptop away into her bag, opened up her notebook, and started writing.</p>
<p>(Also girl, what’s your name?) (He forgot to ask and then it became too late and awkward to ask later)</p>
<p>“My name is Mary.” The writer said, “Mary Sue. Just in case you <em>do</em> remember.” </p>
<p>Well that was definitely not a Japanese name.  </p>
