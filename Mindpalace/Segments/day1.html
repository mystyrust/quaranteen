    <span>hi yall, please keep creators style on -- this work uses a custom work skin, and while it reads best in the default light mode, it <em>should</em> also be compatible with reversi, and most common ao3 site skins. 
        <br />if not, please let me know in the comments if something is weird in a different site skin. 
        <br />anyway, this work requires you to click a few buttons to progress (hopefully its obvious which buttons those are), but no crazy interactions are required. </span>

<p>It was going to be a good day, maybe even a perfect one. </p>
<p>Izuku had gotten a full 8 hours of sleep. He pulled the covers off his bed and stretched his arms out. Ever since moving to the dorms, he didn’t need to wake up as early in order to make it on time to classes. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>you missed your morning run</p></div></div>
<p>After a quick brush of his teeth and wash of his face, Izuku changed into his U.A. uniform and headed to the on campus cafeteria for breakfast. He had a mild headache, but it wasn’t enough to dampen his mood. He was looking forward to school today.</p>
<p>There were a large number of students – Izuku would never find a seat if his friends didn’t save one for him. After going through all of middle school without a single friend, Izuku is thankful to have such good friends. </p>
<p>He grabs a bowl of breakfast and makes his way to the table where his friends had saved him a seat. </p>
<p>“Katsudon for breakfast? A healthy choice!” Tenya commented. The class president was also eating a very hearty meal for breakfast – beef stew. </p>
<p>Izuku takes a look at everyone’s breakfast choices at his friend table – Ochaco was eating ramen, Shoto was eating cold soba; Interesting breakfast choices. </p>
<p>Across the cafeteria, all the students – and even some faculty – were eating breakfast in groups. Some chatted while eating, others ate in silence, but everyone had a companion to eat with. No one was alone. </p>
<p>Except for one person. </p>
<p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes was sitting all alone. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>bro is this some y/n self insert??</p></div></div>
<p>Maybe it was the buzz in his head again, but Izuku felt sorry for the girl. He knew the pain of being lonely, and never wanted another to feel that pain, if he could help it. </p>
<p>Pro heroes were career individuals who performed grand gestures of public service to save lives, but even the little, everyday actions could be heroic to a singular person.</p>
<p>“Hey, do you think we should invite that girl over there to sit with us?” Izuku asked his friends.</p>
