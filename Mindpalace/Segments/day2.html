<div class="userstuff fake-fic">
<p>It could be a good day. </p>
<p>Izuku woke up right before his alarm rang, and went on his morning run. He’d been sleeping in for a few days in a row, and was unable to get any exercise in before class started.  </p>
<p>Well, the reason Izuku woke up early today was because of a headache – he thought he heard someone calling his name, but no one called his phone or stood outside his room, and he decided there was no point in going back to sleep. </p>
<p>He jogged around campus for about an hour, and decided to eat breakfast at the cafeteria before returning to his dorm room to shower and wear his uniform. Since it was very early in the day, the cafeteria was nearly empty, save a few faculty members and students who also woke up early</p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>see now this feels more realistic.</p></div></div>
<p>Izuku picked an omelet but decided to also have some orange juice for his headache. He took a single bite, but he felt… full.  Like he’d eaten an entire serving of katsudon already. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>yeah bc you did</p></div></div>
<p>But that didn’t make sense? He only ate katsudon when his mom made it, and the last time he ate that was weeks ago. Maybe he should get some Katsudon for breakfast anyway, to gauge how different it tasted compared to his mom’s.</p>
<p>Izuku looked around – he knew it was only breakfast time, but for some reason he expected more people to show up. Logically he knew that no one would eat cold soba or spicy tuna rolls for breakfast, but he couldn’t help but feel like he’d seen someone eat those foods for breakfast. Very recently. </p>
<p>Most people who were in the cafeteria at this hour were eating alone, too tired to socialize at this hour. None of them were eating cold soba or spicy tuna rolls, but there was something familiar about the girl eating ramen for breakfast and writing in her notebook. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>ochako ate ramen for breakfast in the last loop</p></div><div class="thought white"><p>that’s not ochako though</p></div></div>
<p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes, was sitting all alone. </p>
<p>Maybe she was in the Gen Ed course? Hero students only meet Gen Ed students during lunch periods and extracurricular activities like the culture or sports festival, so maybe that’s where Izuku had seen her before.  </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>is it just me or is that the same girl from last loop</p></div>  <div class="thought white"><p>no i think you’re onto something</p></div></div>
<p>The warning bell rang, signaling the start of homeroom. Everyone started walking towards the cafeteria exit, and Izuku followed suit.  </p>

<p class="fakenotes region">did some more research and tried to make it more in character this time!  ಥ◡ಥ  im not sure where this will go next</p>
</div>

<div><div class="thought white"><p>yo ninth, wake up</p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>He’s not asleep dumbass</p></div></div>
<p>Izuku’s head pounded.</p>
<p>Maybe he should take a nap – but it would be too hard for him to fall asleep now. Classes for the day hadn’t started yet, and he did work out before coming to the cafeteria for breakfast.</p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>oh he’s gonna try to sleep now</p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>ninth! we’re right here! can you hear us?</p></div></div>
<p>His headache was growing. There was a buzzing in his ear, almost as if he could hear something that wasn’t there. Maybe it was the aftereffects of a concussion? He’d have to get Recovery Girl to check… if it didn’t wear off after his nap. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>maybe i should copy paste the script of the entire bee movie</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>omg NO</p></div></div>
<p>Huh? </p>
<p>Izuku turned his head right and left, looking for the source of the noise. It sounded like there was an argument, and someone screamed “no”. He isn’t sure if he should help them resolve an argument – especially if it’s none of his business – but the cafeteria was nearly empty.</p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>do you think he heard that</p></div></div>
<p>“I… I did hear that,” Izuku responded. “Who are you? Where are you?”</p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>heyyyy there he is!</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>yo ninth</p></div><div class="thought"><p>we were always here! im so mad at you for ignoring us</p></div><div class="thought"><p>this whole day has been weird idk where it started or ended its all blurring together</p></div></div>
<p>“Ah,” Izuku squinted, clutching his head. “O-one at a time, please,” </p>
<p>The vestiges calmed down. </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>we’re the previous holders of OFA</p></div></div>
<p>“Y-yeah, I figured as much,” </p>
<p>The sound was gradually getting louder and clearer, almost as if the speaker was standing right behind Izuku – but no one was there. It had to be from inside his head. </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>did you notice something weird about the past few days? hours?</p></div></div>
<p>“No? Should I have?” </p>
