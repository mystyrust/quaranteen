<p>It was going to be a terrible day. </p>
<p>Izuku felt sick. He slept past his alarm and missed his morning run, and was running late for class. He knew his headache would only worsen if he didn’t have any breakfast, so he decided to stop by the cafeteria to grab some breakfast. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>why not just grab something from the dorm’s kitchen? </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>why does the author insist on making you go to the cafeteria? </p></div></div>
<p>He wished his friends had woken him – so that he’d be on time for breakfast and homeroom, even if he missed his morning run. Maybe they didn’t because he was too much of a burden to his friends. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>you’re not a burden izuku </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>blame the author </p></div> </div>
<p>Izuku’s head continued to pound as he walked into the cafeteria. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>oh man he cant hear us anymore </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>gotta “wake him up” again </p></div> </div>
<p>Most students were walking out of the cafeteria, having already finished eating and getting ready to attend their first class. </p>
<div><div class="thought white"><p>why is breakfast like such a huge meal. This would be more believable if it was lunch time </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>dont ppl just eat toast or a fruit and go to class? </p></div> </div>
<p>There weren’t too many food options left for Izuku to choose from – he picked a bowl of oats from the end of the line, and decided to eat as much of it as he could while walking to his homeroom period – which he was already late for, most likely. As he hurried out, he caught a glimpse of a familiar looking girl sitting alone on one of the tables. </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>its so he can meet that girl, isnt it?</p></div><div class="thought"><p>I think shes the one behind this! Whatever “this” is</p></div> </div>

</div>

<p>Sitting alone at the cafeteria – in a school where connections were everything, admission was based on merit, and merit granted you connections – was weird. Maybe she just needed a private moment to herself?</p>
<p>But sitting alone in the cafeteria and being late for homeroom was weirder. Her laptop was set aside, and she was furiously scribbling away in her notebook – maybe she was so busy, she lost track of time. Izuku could be like that with his hero analysis notes too. </p>
<p>“Are you –” </p>
<p><em>late for homeroom</em> Izuku should say. </p>
<p>The girl looks up, and Izuku catches a brief glimpse of her notebook, before she subtly covers it with her hand. It tells him a lot. </p>
<p>The girl was wearing an unironed UA uniform, and her blonde hair wasn’t properly combed – half of it was covering her eyes. Did she just roll out of bed? </p>

</div>

<p>“ – writing about <me>me?</me>” Izuku says instead. </p>
<p>“Huh? No, of course not!” The girl yelped a little too quickly. “Why is that the first thing you’re asking me, huh? You don’t even know my name!” </p>
<div class="thought"><p>Deflection? Ohohoh</p></div>
<p>“Ah, sorry! That wasn’t what I meant to say, I –” </p>
a/n: Isnt it funny when you try to make a plot and the characters decide to just do their own thing? 
<div class="thought"><p>oh my god it <em>is</em> her, you found her</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>shes the one behind this timeloopy thing</p></div>
<p>“No! I'm not doing any time looping!” she yelled in frustration.</p>
<p>“...I didn’t say anything about time looping,” Izuku said. </p>
<div class="thought"><p>but I did</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>oh my god she CAN hear us</p></div>
<p>The girl’s face twitched as guilt dawned on her face. </p>

<p>“Why? – I mean, <em>how?</em> – are you… doing <em>that?”</em> Izuku asked. </p>
<p>“Doing… what?” </p>
<p>“That thing you did up there, just now!” Izuku tried to point, but didn't know <em>where</em>. He wasn’t referring to a physical location. </p>

<p class="fakenotes region">this thing? </p>
</div>	

<p>“Yes, that!” </p>
<p>“That –! I –! How are <em>you</em> noticing it?” The girl stood up, hands clenched into fists by her side. </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>could be our fault</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>took him a while to hear us</p></div> </div>
<p>“Oh… maybe it’s those guys’ fault,” The girl muttered, not waiting for Izuku’s answer. </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>Hey most of them are guys but I’m a girl</p></div></div>
<p>“Hey, you said it wasn’t a time loop – but if it’s not, then what is it, exactly?” Izuku finally asked. </p>
<p>The girl took a deep breath. </p>
<p>“I think… whatever this is, it is because of me, most likely,” She responded nervously. Something to do with her writing, Izuku had already figured, but he didn’t know why it gave him deja vu, or why it felt like he was living in a groundhog day type loop.</p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>groundhog day-ja vu</p></div> </div>
<p>“The things I wrote happened as I wrote them. I had a couple drafts, so maybe that’s why it felt like a time loop,” She explained. “I guess everyone and everything else reset during each ‘draft’ except for… those… <em>voices</em>,” </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>hey at least the loops were a little different each time, not like that endless eight nonsense</p></div> </div>
<p>“I’m surprised you can hear them too,” Izuku said. “Since they’re supposed to be part of my quirk,”</p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>oh maybe this writing power and hearing us <em>is</em> part of her quirk?</p></div></div>
<p>“I don’t have any type of power or quirk like you think I might, I’m not even supposed to be here. I was just doing some writing and I ended up here in this cafeteria.” </p>
<p>That explained so much and explained nothing at the same time. </p>
<p>“What do you mean you’re not supposed to be here?” Izuku asked. “Because you’re late for homeroom?”</p>
<p>“No, because I’m not even a UA student,” </p>
<p>Izuku gasped. </p>
<p>“I don’t even know where this uniform came from, I don’t know when that happened or why – it’s all really confusing! I wouldn’t even know where to go for homeroom! So I just,... didn’t move from here. And then I did what I always do when I feel nervous and lonely… I wrote.”</p>
<p>Izuku knew the feeling of being trapped, wanting to go home, and turning to imagination as an escape. She also wanted to see the extent of her writing powers. </p>
<p>“Um, do you mind if I see what you wrote?” Izuku asksed. “To get an idea of what you mean, about things happening as you wrote them?” </p>
<p>“Oh no I’m –! It’s embarrassing! It’s just –! I– I was writing about <em>you</em>!” </p>
<p>That was weird, but Izuku was more fascinated by the quirk than how it was used on him. </p>
<p>“Listen, it can’t be that bad if the most that happened was repeating my morning routine a few times,” Izuku said. “Maybe I can help you figure out what you can do with it?” </p>
<p>The girl took a deep breath. </p>
<p>“Okay,” She responded, still nervous. </p>
<p>She pulled her laptop closer, and opened a file. </p>
<p>“Here’s an earlier draft I wrote on my computer,” </p>

<!-- computer -->
<p>“And then, here’s what I’ve been drafting in my notebook,”</p>
<!-- notebook -->

<p>“Y-you’re not weirded out that I wrote about you?” </p>
<p>“Hey, I write observations about the people around me all the time. And, I can tell these aren’t ‘observations’ of me, they’re more like… ‘dications’. Like you’re telling a story,” Izuku responded. “And the fact that your ‘dications’ affected reality at all is amazing! Looks like it doesn’t matter if you type it or handwrite it either!” </p>
<p>“I… discovered this power recently,” the girl admitted. “Nothing happened – at least I think nothing happened – when I wrote a few weird stories for fun. That was before all this happened and I ended up here in UA. But then I found myself here in the cafeteria and decided to experiment. Figure out how much I could do with my words…” </p>
<p>“Could I read those other stuff?” </p>
<p>She gulped. </p>
<p>“Sure, but they’re… look, it’s gonna be cringey,” </p>
