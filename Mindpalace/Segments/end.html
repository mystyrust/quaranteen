<p>It was a good day to be a student at UA. The commute was much easier after the students moved to on-campus dorms.  </p>
<p>Izuku finished his shower – today’s training session for the Hero Studies course was tough – and went to the cafeteria to meet his friends for lunch.  </p>
<p>A few of the class 1-A students had gathered in a single table – Tenya, Shoto, and Ochaco waved when they saw Izuku enter the cafeteria. While Katsuki wasn’t exactly his friend, he was sitting at another table nearby with Kirishima.  </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>this is the most realistic version yet</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>3rd? 4th? time’s the charm</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>idk i lost count how many days we lived in a single day</p></div></div>
<p>Izuku startled at the voices. He couldn’t find the source of them, but he’s definitely heard them before. </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>you forgot our adventures in breaking the 4th wall already?</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>you forgot the bee movie???</p></div> </div>
<p>He was on the verge of remembering something. He knew they were the voices of the vestiges of previous OFA users within him. He might have talked to them before. Did one of them have a favorite movie that they were telling Izuku about?  </p>
<p>Izuku grabbed a bowl of Katsudon from the lunch line.  </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>looks like Mary figured out that katsudon is a lunch time food not a breakfast item</p></div></div>
<p>Mary! Izuku <em>did</em> remember now!  </p>
<p>There was a writer who wrote herself into their reality and then… she edited herself out, to return to where she came from. </p>
<p>Did she make it back to her world? </p>
<p>Izuku was still ‘real’ – as ‘real’ as he could feel and confirm himself to be. </p>
<p>Izuku wondered where she was now, and what she was doing. Writing? Or reading whatever was happening to him at this very moment. Izuku wished he asked her for spoilers, for how his story would end. </p>
<p>Izuku wouldn’t mind the sick hair though; He decided he would get a haircut after school today. </p>
<p>Would the haircut have stayed if she didn’t delete her draft mid-writing? Would any effects she wrote into reality persist after she left it? </p>
<p>Izuku wouldn’t know, unless she came back again, and was able to travel to and from her world at will. And despite having his world view literally shattered, despite reading the weirdest fanfictions of himself, Izuku realized he wouldn’t mind if he saw the writer again. </p>
<p>He hoped she was still writing. </p>
