<p>Izuku was back in the cafeteria, standing where he last remembered. But the writer was not where Izuku last remembered seeing her. Her notebook and bag were gone too. She was nowhere in sight – the cafeteria was empty, everyone having left a while ago for homeroom.  </p>
<p>“It’s not like there’s anywhere to hide in the cafeteria here,” Izuku thought. “The school is so big she can avoid seeing me for days and then I’ll never be able to apologize!” </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>I have another idea</p></div></div>
<p>“Huh, like what?” </p>
<div class="thought"><p>so I think we can break the 4th wall too</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>not as good as she can, but good enough to find her</p></div> 
<div><div class="thought"><p>turn off the creator’s style, izuku</p></div></div>
<p>“Huh? How would I do that?”  </p>
<p>How would that affect the cafeteria he was in? It was empty, everyone had already left for homeroom, which Izuku was incredibly late for.  </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>there’s that button on the top that lets you turn it off</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>ignore that authors note that tells you to leave it on</p></div> </div>
<p>“What,... are you guys sure this is the right way to do this?”  </p>
<p>Was it related to that writer’s power? </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>yeah trust us</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>if you’re too scared to scroll up and press that button yourself i can bring a copy of it down here for you</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>not sure if we’ll carry over but good luck!!</p></div></div>
