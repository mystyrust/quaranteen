<p>“So, this is stuff you wrote in the past, and it didn’t affect reality.” Izuku said. “And stuff you wrote after transporting here did affect reality – this reality. Does that work for everything you write? Did some event that happened when you got ‘isekaied’ also grant you this quirk?”</p>  
<p>“So my theory is that I can only affect reality if it's canon compliant – the reality I think is canon, I mean? Because in the stuff I wrote that did affect reality, nothing interesting happened, but it was all technically canon compliant too. The old stuff was all AUs.” </p>  
<p>Okay, so Izuku’s reality was the ‘canon’ reality, according to the girl. Noted. Was it ‘real’ to her?</p>  
<p>“Hmm… I think it has less to do with the content and more to do with the technique?”</p>  
<p>“What do you mean?” The girl looked back and forth between her laptop and her notebook. </p>  
<p>“Let’s try this. I’ll dictate and you write – or type, whichever you want.” </p>

        <p>Izuku midoriya was six feet tall and he had shredded abs. His green mohawk hair framed his eyes and sent a piercing glare that would make villains cower in <img src="https://progress-tracker.mystyrust.repl.co/images/baddraft.svg" class="typer-svg"/> </p>

<p>“A mohawk wouldn't frame your eyes… right?” the writer asked. “And if your eyes were covered, would you be able to look scary? Or emo?”  </p>
<p>“Yeah, and I’m not six feet tall either… so I didn’t think that would work.” </p>
<p>Izuku hummed in thought. </p>

        <p>Izuku’s green hair was growing long and curling in front of his eyes – it was making it harder to see the trail in front of him, especially when he went jogging at dawn. He needed a haircut. </p>
        <p>He went to the barber after school the day before, who trimmed the front bangs of his hair. Izuku liked the undercut look on one of the pictures, so the barber shaved the back of Izuku’s head while leaving the top and front <img src="https://progress-tracker.mystyrust.repl.co/images/gooddraft.svg" class="typer-svg"/> </p>
    </div>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>“Hey, that worked!” </p>
<p>Izuku’s hair was no longer a uniform ball of broccoli curls; the length was trimmed all around and there was a neatly shaved undercut shaved on the back of his neck. </p>
<p>“But that hair isn’t canon! And I just wrote more words!” </p>
<p>The writer was baffled. She thought this test wouldn’t work because it would have to be words <em>she</em> chose to write, instead of someone else’s dictation – so what did Izuku figure out that she hadn’t?</p>
<p>“No, you can’t affect reality if your writing is bad – it has to be believable, logical, and not just full of info dumps. I think you have to be able to suspend disbelief. To suck the reader into a reality so different from their own!”</p>
<p>“Bad?!”</p>
<p>Uh oh. Izuku overstepped. </p>
<p>“I’ve never shown anyone – anyone I know, I mean – my writing because I knew it was bad. It was cringey. I’d be made fun of for writing weird stories that no one even liked. It’s one thing for a bully or a hater to make fun of my writing. But it’s an entirely other matter when my own subject can scientifically prove what a bad writer I am.”</p>
<p>Izuku didn’t realize how personal it was to her.</p>
<p>“Was! Not <em>anymore</em> but –” </p>
