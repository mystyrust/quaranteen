    <p>Izuku midoriya was destined to be a hero, and no quirk or not having one would stop him from being one. If he couldnt be a hero legally hed just have to be one illegally. </p>
    <p>Comic books from the pre quirk era would document how people without quirks would fight crime and be heros by using technology and tools and masking theyre identities to protect their loved ones so Izuku would have no choice but to do the same.  </p>
    <p>He realizeed how inaddequeaate the heroes were after a kid died from a sludge villain attack that kid was his best friend katsuki </p>
    <p class="fade-text">the greenette was smart he could invent anything and hack anything hed bean a hacker since he was seven and learnnig martical arts since he was 5 when the doctor told him he was quirkless </p>

  <p>“Okay let me close that link so we can talk normally for a bit,” </p>
  <p>Izuku touched his hands, face, and hair. His body was never lost, but for a moment it felt like it was. </p>
  <p>“So here’s a really awkward explanation – I’m not from this world. I'm not from <em>your</em> world.” She started. “Where I'm from, there’s no heroes, no quirks,” </p>
  <p>Izuku’s face morphed into horror. His whole life revolved around heroes and quirks, so he couldn’t imagine what it would be like to grow up in a place where those didn’t even exist. </p>
  <p>“But everyone knows about you because your story is a really popular manga –” </p>
  <p>“Manga?!”  </p>
  <p>“– and a bunch of people write fanfiction for it –”</p>
  <p>“<em>Fanfiction</em>?!”</p>
  <p>“ – and somehow while writing fanfic, I guess I accidentally isekaied myself here.”</p>
  <p>“<em>ISEKAI???</em>”</p>
  <p>Izuku was at a loss for words. His reality was a sandbox playground for someone else to write in, and he wasn’t sure how to feel about that just yet. </p>
  <p>“You know… transported to another world?” The girl probed.</p>
  <p>“I know what that means! It’s just, I – we’re all real here!” He had his own agency, his own free will, his own choices… right? But maybe the “writers’ sandbox” could explain why there was never a shortage of unique quirks. </p>
  <p>“Yeah, I was surprised to discover that – I wouldn't be surprised if every other popular fanfic AU was also real. Another universe out there somewhere in the multiverse. There’s a ton of fanfic writers, who knows how many of them accidentally write themselves into their own stories?” The writer responded.</p>
  <p>Izuku didn’t like the implication that he was ‘not real’, but the idea of other universes was interesting enough to focus on. </p>
  <p>“I wonder if events from your universe would exist as fictional stories in ours?” he mused.  </p>
  <p>“Probably. I wouldn’t be surprised.” </p>
  <p>Okay, so she didn’t necessarily consider her reality as ‘superior’ for being ‘real’. Izuku was beginning to question what was and wasn’t real, and if everything fake somewhere was real somewhere else. What did it mean to be real? </p>
  <p>“So, you physically transported yourself… into a story you were writing?” Izuku asked.</p>
  <p>“A fanfic that I was writing, of another manga that I was reading,” the girl corrected. “But not for that fanfic we just read, I was never transported into that one.”</p>
  <p>Was the story ‘real’? </p>
  <p>“You’re taking this awfully well.” </p>
  <p>“Oh don’t worry, I am freaking out plenty,” Izuku replied. It was weird enough to read about a reality where he might not have attended UA; good thing he wasn’t transported to it. </p>
  <p>But maybe by reading about these alternate realities, he could learn something – about the world that this writer came from, about her ability, and maybe about himself. And what it means to be ‘real’.</p>
  <p>Oh my goodness he didn’t even know her name yet. </p>
  <p>“Here’s one other thing I’ve written, that didn’t affect reality – I think – and I wasn’t transported to it either,” </p>
  <p>She pulled up her laptop and navigated to another webpage.</p>
