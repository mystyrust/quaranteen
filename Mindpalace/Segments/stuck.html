<p>There’s nothing. No darkness no light. Izuku felt a weight in the back of his head return, and confirmed with a touch of his hair that it’s back to its original length. </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>well the undercut was nice while it lasted</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>you should get that haircut for real though, it looked good</p></div></div>
<p>“You guys are still here?” </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>we never left!</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>we were reading the fanfic and stuff, same as you</p></div></div>
<div><div class="thought"><p>i wanted to copy paste the script of the bee movie but they stopped me</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>didn’t want to interrupt</p></div></div>
<p>“I might have made a mistake, and accidentally offended her,”</p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>haha yeah that was painful to watch</p></div> </div>
<p>“I want to apologize to her, but I need to get out of here first!”</p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>wherever here is</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>wait, do you think you can do that “end note” thing she was always doing?</p></div> </div>
<p>“No, I don’t think so,” Izuku responded. “That was always her quirk. Her power, not mine,” </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>but you became aware of it and broke out of the loops or whatever because of us, somehow, so we should be able to help you again!</p></div></div>
<p>The vestiges began whispering inwardly among themselves – Izuku wondered how often they communicated with each other without his awareness.  </p>
<div><div class="thought"><p>often enough, kid</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>okay we’re gonna try something</p></div></div>
