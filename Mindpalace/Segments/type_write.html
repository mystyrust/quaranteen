        <p>It was a perfect day! </p>
        <p>Izuku got a full 8 hours of sleep and was looking forward to school ever since he started living on UA’s campus. He woke up early before school to go on a jog, and then went to the cafeteria to grab breakfast. He ate his favorite food, Katsudon.</p>
        <p>The cafeteria was full. He sat next to his friends Shoto, Ochako, and Tenya, who were eating all their favorite foods for breakfast, too. He ate the katsudon. It wasn’t as good as the one his mom used to make, but it was still very good.</p>
        <p>Across the cafeteria, all the students – and even some faculty – were eating breakfast in groups. Some chatted while eating, others ate in silence, but everyone had a companion to eat with. No one was alone. </p>
        <p>Except one person. </p>
        <p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes was sitting all alone. </p>
        <p>Izuku decided to invite her to sit with his friends for breakfast. </p>

        <p>Izuku’s green hair was growing long and curling in front of his eyes – it was making it harder to see the trail in front of him, especially when he went jogging at dawn. He needed a haircut. </p>
        <p>He went to the barber after school the day before, who trimmed the front bangs of his hair. Izuku liked the undercut look on one of the pictures, so the barber shaved the back of Izuku’s head while leaving the top and front as is. </p>

        <p><del>The cafeteria was full. He sat next to his friends Shoto, Ochako, Tenya, and Kacchan, who were eating all their favorite foods for breakfast, too. He ate the katsudon. It wasn’t as good as the one his mom used to make, but it was still very good. </del></p>
        <p><del>The first subject of the day, after homeroom, was hero studies – the students would need to eat well and have a lot of energy for training in Ground Gamma! </del></p>
        <p>The cafeteria was mostly empty, since it was breakfast time. Izuku sat by himself, scrolling through his phone and looking up the latest hero news on social medias. </p>
        <p>Another girl also sat by herself in another table, eating her breakfast while writing in her notebook. </p>
        <p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes was sitting all alone. </p>
        <p>Maybe she was in the Gen Ed course? Hero students only meet Gen Ed students during lunch periods and extracurricular activities like the culture or sports festival, so maybe that’s where Izuku had seen her before.</p>
