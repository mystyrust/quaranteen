    <p>“Alright,” Izuku said. “I’m here now, guys. Where should I look?” </p>
    <p>Izuku was addressing the vestiges, but they were silent. A side effect of turning off the “creator’s style”, perhaps. </p>
    <p>Everything looked the same as far as he could tell: same cafeteria, same benches, same notebook in–</p>
    <p>“Ah! You’re here!” </p>
    <p>It was as if the writer had never moved from her spot, and she was just sitting there invisibly the entire time, watching Izuku.</p>
    <p>“How are you seeing me?!” She exclaimed. “Did you… turn the CSS <em>off</em>?” </p>
    <p>“I… think so?” Izuku responded. </p>
    <p>“Hmph, this takes ‘characters deciding their own plot’ to a whole new level. Why are you even here? To tell me what a bad writer I am?” The girl threw her notebook across the room. “Well, you don’t have to, I already know!” </p>
    <p>“No!” Izuku exclaimed. “I wanted to apologize for that,” </p>
    <p>She glared silently.</p>
    <p>Whether he was ‘real’ or not, or she was ‘real’ or not, the girl was hurt – and that was real enough to matter.</p>
    <p>“I mean, you’re not that writer anymore, it’s okay that you were bad once, and you’re better now –”</p>
    <p>“I notice that you’re not <em>actually</em> saying sorry for calling my old stuff bad,”</p>
    <p>“Look, I never asked to be the subject of your writing, or for your writing to affect <em>my</em> life, <em>my </em>reality! So I think I deserve to have an <em>opinion</em> about your writing,” </p>
    <p>Izuku was on the verge of yelling. The writer at least had the decency to look guilty.</p>
    <p>“– because we all start somewhere,” Izuku sighed as he continued. “I was terrible at using my quirk when I first inherited it. Even All Might thought so.”</p>
    <p>He looked down at the palm of his hands, calluses and scars covering them both. A far cry from the smooth skin he used to have, before he got a quirk.</p>
    <p>“I’d never be an expert today, if I quit as a rookie yesterday.” Izuku said. “You’ve read my story, you know how it goes, right?” </p>
    <p><em>That </em>seemed to capture her attention. </p>
    <p>“The blood sweat and tears from grueling hours of training, the mocking of my peers – how a person like me, who wasn’t born with a quirk, could never make it into UA. As much as I wanted to get into UA for myself, because it was my dream, I wanted to get in to also prove the haters wrong.”  </p>
    <p>Izuku knew what it felt like being ridiculed for what others considered an ‘impossible’ dream. He walked over to where the thrown notebook lay, picking it up delicately and making sure none of the pages were bent or ripped when he closed it. </p>
    <p>“You’re already getting better at it, if the fact that you were able to affect my reality means anything at all.” Izuku said. “So, if writing is something you want to get better at, don’t quit. The pen is mightier than the sword, just be careful not to turn it towards yourself.” </p>
    <p>He handed the notebook back to its owner, the writer. </p>
    <p>“Some blunt sword my pen is,” She grumbled. “I’m sorry you were on the receiving end of it.”</p>
    <p>Frankly, Izuku didn’t expect an apology; though he definitely thought he <em>deserved</em> one, he was just not used to actually getting it. Maybe he was more similar to the writer than he thought. </p>
    <p>“It might seem like that now, blunt sword or whatever, but once you get good enough at writing, maybe you could write us a world without villains, without crime, and without poverty,” Izuku mused. “A blunt sword is better than no sword, and can be shaped into a sharp one.” Izuku felt like the analogy was falling apart a little, but he tried his best.</p>
    <p>She took the notebook from his hand.</p>
    <p>“Would anyone ‘suspend disbelief’ for a story with that type of perfect setting?” she said. “No conflict, no evil? Besides, does that mean everything I write, good AND bad, would affect reality? Your reality? Because I wouldn’t mind good effects, but I wouldn’t want bad ones. Doesn’t that mean I should still stop writing?” </p>
    <p>“I have another theory why your writing affected reality – you’re in it, and I read it. That creates a paradox that would have never existed if you had never traveled outside your world.” Izuku mumbled. “Besides, how did you get here in the first place?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t entirely remember… but I noticed that a character based on my appearance was in my drafts – my ‘self insert’ technically – and maybe that has something to do with why I’m here, when I shouldn’t be?” </p>
    <p>“What if…” Izuku didn’t like this idea, but he had to say it. “What if you wrote yourself out of your drafts?” </p>
    <p>“Huh?” the girl panicked. </p>
    <p>“I don’t mean killing the character off! I mean just… removing mentions of yourself from your latest draft. That would naturally slot you out of the narrative when it plays out in reality,… right? That way, you can continue writing about us or… whatever you want, and it won’t affect this reality if you’re not in it anymore, right?” </p>
    <p>“So I can never write RPF? Or project myself into the characters I write?” The girl asked. Her question wasn’t with malice, but a curiosity of what her words can and can’t – or, shouldn’t – do. </p>
    <p>“I… don’t think that’s entirely true. Autobiographies and memoirs exist. Newspapers and Textbooks exist.” Izuku thought out loud. “Besides, some type of inspiration is always taken from reality – or other fiction. No one exists in a vacuum…” </p>
    <p>“But my power won’t affect <em>my own</em> reality?” </p>
    <p>“I don’t know – I <em>wouldn’t</em> know. But no quirk – or power – is ever <em>evil</em>, it’s only the user. All quirks should be honed and practiced, and then harnessed for the greater good.” Izuku smiled. “And if your power <em>does</em> affect your reality, well, I bet you can do so much good with it.” </p>
    <p>Izuku wondered if the face he made when looking at his hero analysis notes was the same look the writer had on her face, looking at her own notebook.</p>
    <p>“That… okay, that kind of makes sense, I think,” The girl responded. “I need to find a way to practice writing without it affecting reality. But… when I fix my draft and remove myself from it, will <em>you</em>remember any of this?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” Izuku admitted. “The vestiges might? Those voices, I mean. But I wouldn’t count on it, they haven’t always been present.”</p>
    <p>(<strong>that’s so rude, we’re right here.</strong>) (<strong>a little bare bones but we made it too!</strong>)</p>
    <p>Izuku and the girl laughed. </p>
    <p>“Besides, if you remember my advice, and keep practicing, I think that’s good enough for me,” </p>
    <p>(<strong>He’s right! You don’t become an expert overnight!</strong>) </p>
    <p>The girl tucked her laptop away into her bag, opened up her notebook, and started writing.</p>
    <p>(<strong>Also girl, what’s your name?</strong>) (<strong>He forgot to ask and then it became too late and awkward to ask later</strong>)</p>
    <p>“<em>Why</em> would you guys say that?” Izuku covered his face in embarrassment, but the writer didn't seem to notice. </p>
    <p>“My name is Mary.” The writer said, “Mary Sue. Just in case you <em>do</em> remember.” </p>
    <p>Well that was definitely not a Japanese name.  </p>

        <p>It was a good day to be a student at UA. The commute was much easier after the students moved to on-campus dorms.  </p>
        <p>Izuku finished his shower – today’s training session for the Hero Studies course was tough – and went to the cafeteria to meet his friends for lunch.  </p>
        <p>A few of the class 1-A students had gathered in a single table – Tenya, Shoto, and Ochaco waved when they saw Izuku enter the cafeteria. While Katsuki wasn’t exactly his friend, he was sitting at another table nearby with Kirishima.  </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>this is the most realistic version yet</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>3rd? 4th? time’s the charm</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>idk i lost count how many days we lived in a single day</p></div></div>
        <p>Izuku startled at the voices. He couldn’t find the source of them, but he’s definitely heard them before. </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>you forgot our adventures in breaking the 4th wall already?</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>you forgot the bee movie???</p></div> </div>
        <p>He was on the verge of remembering something. He knew they were the voices of the vestiges of previous OFA users within him. He might have talked to them before. Did one of them have a favorite movie that they were telling Izuku about?  </p>
        <p>Izuku grabbed a bowl of Katsudon from the lunch line.  </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>looks like Mary figured out that katsudon is a lunch time food not a breakfast item</p></div></div>
        <p>Mary! Izuku <em>did</em> remember now!  </p>
        <p>There was a writer who wrote herself into their reality and then… she edited herself out, to return to where she came from. </p>
        <p>Did she make it back to her world? </p>
        <p>Izuku was still ‘real’ – as ‘real’ as he could feel and confirm himself to be. </p>
        <p>Izuku wondered where she was now, and what she was doing. Writing? Or reading whatever was happening to him at this very moment. Izuku wished he asked her for spoilers, for how his story would end -- though Izuku wonders if she would have even given any. </p>
        <p>Izuku wouldn’t mind the sick hair though; He decided he would get a haircut after school today. </p>
        <p>Would the haircut have stayed if she didn’t delete her draft mid-writing? Would any effects she wrote into reality persist after she left it? </p>
        <p>Izuku wouldn’t know, unless she came back again, and was able to travel to and from her world at will. And despite having his world view literally shattered, despite reading the weirdest fanfictions of himself, Izuku realized he wouldn’t mind if he saw the writer again -- maybe with more practice and experience under her belt. </p>
        <p>He hoped she was still writing. </p>

        <p>Izuku was back in the cafeteria, standing where he last remembered. But the writer was not where Izuku last remembered seeing her. Her notebook and bag were gone too. She was nowhere in sight – the cafeteria was empty, everyone having left a while ago for homeroom.  </p>
        <p>“It’s not like there’s anywhere to hide in the cafeteria here,” Izuku thought. “The school is so big she can avoid seeing me for days and then I’ll never be able to apologize!” </p>

    <p>There’s nothing. No darkness no light. No cafeteria in sight. Izuku wasn’t sure if he was just blind, or actually transported elsewhere. He felt a weight in the back of his head return, and confirmed with a touch of his hair that it’s back to its original length. </p>
    <div><div class="thought"><p>well the undercut was nice while it lasted</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>you should get that haircut for real though, it looked good</p></div></div>

    <div><div class="thought"><p>You know what’s real? The bee movie.</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>You’re 'really' annoying you know that. Not you Izuku, I'm talking to this guy.</p></div></div>
    <p>Izuku laughed, and that helped loosen the tension in his shoulders a little. </p>
    <p>“I might have made a mistake, and accidentally offended her,”</p>
    <div><div class="thought"><p>haha yeah that was painful to watch</p></div> </div>
    <p>“I want to apologize to her, but I need to get out of here first!” He didn’t know the writer that well, and didn’t want to leave a bad impression either. Maybe it was the people pleaser in him. </p>

    <p>“No, I don’t think so,” Izuku responded. “That was always her quirk. Her power, not mine,” </p>
    <div><div class="thought"><p>but you became aware of it and broke out of the loops or whatever because of us, somehow, so we should be able to help you again!</p></div></div>
    <p>The vestiges began whispering inwardly among themselves – Izuku wondered how often they communicated with each other without his awareness.  </p>

        <p>“So, this is stuff you wrote in the past, and it didn’t affect reality.” Izuku said. “And stuff you wrote after transporting here did affect reality – this reality. Does that work for everything you write? Did some event that happened when you got ‘isekaied’ also grant you this quirk?”</p>  
        <p>“So my theory is that I can only affect reality if it's canon compliant – the reality I think is canon, I mean? Because in the stuff I wrote that did affect reality, nothing interesting happened, but it was all technically canon compliant too. The old stuff was all AUs.” </p>  
        <p>Okay, so Izuku’s reality was the ‘canon’ reality, according to the girl. Noted. Was it ‘real’ to her?</p>  
        <p>“Hmm… I think it has less to do with the content and more to do with the technique?”</p>

                <p>Izuku’s green hair was growing long and curling in front of his eyes – it was making it harder to see the trail in front of him, especially when he went jogging at dawn. He needed a haircut. </p>
                <p>He went to the barber after school the day before, who trimmed the front bangs of his hair. Izuku liked the undercut look on one of the pictures, so the barber shaved the back of Izuku’s head while leaving the top and front <img src="https://progress-tracker.mystyrust.repl.co/images/gooddraft.svg" class="typer-svg"/> </p>

        <p>The writer was baffled. She thought this test wouldn’t work because it would have to be words <em>she</em> chose to write, instead of someone else’s dictation – so what did Izuku figure out that she hadn’t?</p>
        <p>“No, you can’t affect reality if your writing is bad – it has to be believable, logical, and not just full of info dumps. I think you have to be able to suspend disbelief. To suck the reader into a reality so different from their own!”</p>
        <p>“Bad?!”</p>
        <p>Uh oh. Izuku overstepped. </p>
        <p>“I’ve never shown anyone – anyone I know, I mean – my writing because I knew it was bad. It was cringey. I’d be made fun of for writing weird stories that no one even liked. It’s one thing for a bully or a hater to make fun of my writing. But it’s an entirely other matter when my own subject can scientifically prove what a bad writer I am.”</p>
        <p>Izuku didn’t realize how personal it was to her.</p>
        <p>“Was! Not <em>anymore</em> but –” </p>

<!-- fake fic words -->
<div class="userstuff fake-fic">
    <p>After a terribly miserable highschool experience for being made fun of for not haveing a quirk, Izuku was one jump away from ending it all himslef. And then when kacchan said to take a swan dive off the roof he decided to go ahead and do it maybe hed get a quirk in the next life <br />
    Except maybe the next life wasnt so far away when izuku felt his broken bones fuse back into place and his bruises fade away. He jumped and then he died and then he died. He expected to start the next life as a baby not as hiimseslf exactly where he left off. <br />
    Thats because izuku did have a quirk after all he could return to life after he died. He was practically immortal. The hero industry didnt deserve him and he needed to get revenge on all the people who made fun of him for not haeving a querk and being querkless. Lets see how they like it when they take a swan dive off the roof and their bodies dont stitch themselves backtogether then maybe tehy could feel a fraction of the pain izkuk felt. </p>
    <p class="fade-text">Maybe the hero industry didnt desrve him but the villains did.</p>

    <p>Izuku midoriya was destined to be a hero, and no quirk or not having one would stop him from being one. If he couldnt be a hero legally hed just have to be one illegally. </p>
    <p>Comic books from the pre quirk era would document how people without quirks would fight crime and be heros by using technology and tools and masking theyre identities to protect their loved ones so Izuku would have no choice but to do the same.  </p>
    <p>He realizeed how inaddequeaate the heroes were after a kid died from a sludge villain attack that kid was his best friend katsuki </p>
    <p class="fade-text">the greenette was smart he could invent anything and hack anything hed bean a hacker since he was seven and learnnig martical arts since he was 5 when the doctor told him he was quirkless </p>

  <p>“Okay let me close that link so we can talk normally for a bit,” </p>
  <p>Izuku touched his hands, face, and hair. His body was never lost, but for a moment it felt like it was. </p>
  <p>“So here’s a really awkward explanation – I’m not from this world. I'm not from <em>your</em> world.” She started. “Where I'm from, there’s no heroes, no quirks,” </p>
  <p>Izuku’s face morphed into horror. His whole life revolved around heroes and quirks, so he couldn’t imagine what it would be like to grow up in a place where those didn’t even exist. </p>
  <p>“But everyone knows about you because your story is a really popular manga –”</p>
  <p>“Manga?!”  </p>
  <p>“– and a bunch of people write fanfiction for it –”</p>
  <p>“<em>Fanfiction</em>?!”</p>
  <p>“ – and somehow while writing fanfic, I guess I accidentally isekaied myself here.”</p>
  <p>“<em>ISEKAI???</em>”</p>
  <p>Izuku facepalmed, at a loss for words. His reality was a sandbox playground for someone else to write in, and he wasn’t sure how to feel about that just yet. </p>
  <p>“You know… transported to another world?” The girl probed.</p>
  <p>“I know what that means! It’s just, I – we’re all real here!” He had his own agency, his own free will, his own choices… right?</p>
  <p>“Yeah, I was surprised to discover that – I wouldn't be surprised if every other popular fanfic AU was also real. Another universe out there somewhere in the multiverse. There’s a ton of fanfic writers, who knows how many of them accidentally write themselves into their own stories?” The writer responded.</p>
  <p>Izuku didn’t like the implication that he was ‘not real’, but the idea of other universes was interesting enough to focus on. </p>
  <p>“Why write about <em>me</em> though?” Izuku asked. “You could write about All Might or Eraserhead or Kamui Woods, or… literally any other hero?”</p>
  <p>“Well, you’re the main character,” the girl responded without missing a beat, and yet, it underwhelmed Izuku. He thought being the protagonist would offer him some sort of advantage, some sort of benefit, instead of being quirkless by birth. </p>
  <p>“Since the manga is an underdog story, you were the best protagonist – not someone who was born with a cool quirk, and not someone who was already an established hero. It’s what made the manga super popular!” She added. </p>
  <p>Well now it felt like an invasion of privacy.</p>
  <p>The idea that Izuku would have still remained quirkless, that Kacchan would have <em>died </em>came from this writer – from <em>many</em> fanfic writers, if this was a popular trope to write about – irked him. If there existed infinite alternate universes, as there were sure to, then this fictional trope would be another Izuku’s reality. It was terrifying. </p>
  <p>And, depending on how the girl’s quirk worked – those ideas that exist in other realities <em>could</em> exist in this one. It was both terrifying and exciting. Could she write a new quirk into existence?</p>
  <p>If multiple – alternate – versions of Izuku’s reality exist, could alternate versions of the girl’s reality also exist? </p>
  <p>“I wonder if events from your universe would exist as fictional stories in ours?” he mused.</p>
  <p>“Probably. I wouldn’t be surprised.” </p>
  <p>Okay, so she didn’t necessarily consider her reality as ‘superior’ for being ‘real’. Izuku was beginning to question what was and wasn’t real, and if everything fake somewhere was real somewhere else. </p>
  <p>An inverse relationship with reality? What did it mean to be real? </p>
  <p>“So, you physically transported yourself… into a story you were writing?” Izuku asked.</p>
  <p>“A fanfic that I was writing, of another manga that I was reading,” the girl corrected. “But not for that fanfic we just read, I was never transported into that one.”</p>
  <p>How ‘real’ was every story penned by man? </p>
  <p>“You’re taking this awfully well.” </p>
  <p>“Oh don’t worry, I am freaking out plenty,” Izuku’s voice helpfully wavered as he answered. Good thing he wasn’t actually transported to a reality where he did not attend UA – reading about it was weird enough. </p>
  <p>But maybe by reading about these alternate realities, he could learn something – about the world that this writer came from, about her ability, and maybe about himself. And what it means to be ‘real’... maybe.</p>
  <p>Oh my goodness he didn’t even know her name yet. </p>
  <p>“Here’s one other thing I’ve written, that didn’t affect reality – I think – and I wasn’t transported to it either,” </p>
  <p>She pulled up her laptop and navigated to another webpage.</p>

        <p>It was going to be a terrible day. </p>
        <p>Izuku felt sick. He slept past his alarm and missed his morning run, and was running late for class. He knew his headache would only worsen if he didn’t have any breakfast, so he decided to stop by the cafeteria to grab some breakfast. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>why not just grab something from the dorm’s kitchen? </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>why does the author insist on making you go to the cafeteria? </p></div></div>
        <p>He wished his friends had woken him – so that he’d be on time for breakfast and homeroom, even if he missed his morning run. Maybe they didn’t because he was too much of a burden to his friends. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>you’re not a burden izuku </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>blame the author </p></div> </div>
        <p>Izuku’s head continued to pound as he walked into the cafeteria. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>oh man he cant hear us anymore </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>gotta “wake him up” again </p></div> </div>
        <p>Most students were walking out of the cafeteria, having already finished eating and getting ready to attend their first class. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>why is breakfast like such a huge meal. This would be more believable if it was lunch time </p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>dont ppl just eat toast or a fruit and go to class? </p></div> </div>
        <p>There weren’t too many food options left for Izuku to choose from – he picked a bowl of oats from the end of the line, and decided to eat as much of it as he could while walking to his homeroom period – which he was already late for, most likely. As he hurried out, he caught a glimpse of a familiar looking girl sitting alone on one of the tables. </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>its so he can meet that girl, isnt it?</p></div><div class="thought"><p>I think shes the one behind this! Whatever “this” is</p></div> </div>

        <p>Sitting alone at the cafeteria – in a school where connections were everything, admission was based on merit, and merit granted you connections – was weird. Maybe she just needed a private moment to herself?</p>
        <p>But sitting alone in the cafeteria and being late for homeroom was weirder. Her laptop was set aside, and she was furiously scribbling away in her notebook – maybe she was so busy, she lost track of time. Izuku could be like that with his hero analysis notes too. </p>
        <p>“Are you –” </p>
        <p><em>late for homeroom</em> Izuku should say. </p>
        <p>The girl looks up, and Izuku catches a brief glimpse of her notebook, before she subtly covers it with her hand. It tells him a lot. </p>
        <p>The girl was wearing an unironed UA uniform, and her blonde hair wasn’t properly combed – half of it was covering her eyes. Did she just roll out of bed? </p>

        <p>“ – writing about <me>me?</me>” Izuku says instead. </p>
        <p>“Huh? No, of course not!” The girl yelped a little too quickly. “Why is that the first thing you’re asking me, huh? You don’t even know my name!” </p>

        <p>“Yes, that!” </p>
        <p>“That –! I –! How are <em>you</em> noticing it?” The girl stood up, hands clenched into fists by her side. </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>could be our fault</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>took him a while to hear us</p></div> </div>
        <p>“Oh… maybe it’s those guys’ fault,” The girl muttered, not waiting for Izuku’s answer. </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>Hey most of them are guys but I’m a girl</p></div></div>
        <p>“Hey, you said it wasn’t a time loop – but if it’s not, then what is it, exactly?” Izuku finally asked. </p>
        <p>The girl took a deep breath. </p>
        <p>“I think… whatever this is, it is because of me, most likely,” She responded nervously. Something to do with her writing, Izuku had already figured, but he didn’t know why it gave him deja vu, or why it felt like he was living in a groundhog day type loop.</p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>groundhog day-ja vu</p></div> </div>
        <p>“The things I wrote happened as I wrote them. I had a couple drafts, so maybe that’s why it felt like a time loop,” She explained. “I guess everyone and everything else reset during each ‘draft’ except for… those… <em>voices</em>,” </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>hey at least the loops were a little different each time, not like that endless eight nonsense</p></div> </div>
        <p>“I’m surprised you can hear them too,” Izuku said. “Since they’re supposed to be part of my quirk,”</p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>oh maybe this writing power and hearing us <em>is</em> part of her quirk?</p></div></div>
        <p>“I don’t have any type of power or quirk like you think I might, I’m not even supposed to be here. I was just doing some writing and I ended up here in this cafeteria.” </p>
        <p>That explained so much and explained nothing at the same time. </p>
        <p>“What do you mean you’re not supposed to be here?” Izuku asked. “Because you’re late for homeroom?”</p>
        <p>“No, because I’m not even a UA student,” </p>
        <p>Izuku gasped. </p>
        <p>“I don’t even know where this uniform came from, I don’t know when that happened or why – it’s all really confusing! I wouldn’t even know where to go for homeroom! So I just,... didn’t move from here. And then I did what I always do when I feel nervous and lonely… I wrote.”</p>
        <p>Izuku knew the feeling of being trapped, wanting to go home, and turning to imagination as an escape. She also wanted to see the extent of her writing powers. </p>
        <p>“Um, do you mind if I see what you wrote?” Izuku asksed. “To get an idea of what you mean, about things happening as you wrote them?” </p>
        <p>“Oh no I’m –! It’s embarrassing! It’s just –! I– I was writing about <em>you</em>!” </p>
        <p>That was weird, but Izuku was more fascinated by the quirk than how it was used on him. </p>
        <p>“Listen, it can’t be that bad if the most that happened was repeating my morning routine a few times,” Izuku said. “Maybe I can help you figure out what you can do with it?” </p>
        <p>The girl took a deep breath. </p>
        <p>“Okay,” She responded, still nervous. </p>
        <p>She pulled her laptop closer, and opened a file. </p>

                <p>It was a perfect day! </p>
                <p>Izuku got a full 8 hours of sleep and was looking forward to school ever since he started living on UA’s campus. He woke up early before school to go on a jog, and then went to the cafeteria to grab breakfast. He ate his favorite food, Katsudon.</p>
                <p>The cafeteria was full. He sat next to his friends Shoto, Ochako, and Tenya, who were eating all their favorite foods for breakfast, too. He ate the katsudon. It wasn’t as good as the one his mom used to make, but it was still very good.</p>
                <p>Across the cafeteria, all the students – and even some faculty – were eating breakfast in groups. Some chatted while eating, others ate in silence, but everyone had a companion to eat with. No one was alone. </p>
                <p>Except one person. </p>
                <p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes was sitting all alone. </p>
                <p>Izuku decided to invite her to sit with his friends for breakfast. <img src="https://progress-tracker.mystyrust.repl.co/images/cursor.svg" class="typer-svg"/></p>

                <p>It was going to be a <del>perfect</del> good day! </p>
                <p>Izuku got a full 8 hours of sleep and was looking forward to school ever since he started living on UA’s campus. He woke up early before school to go on a jog, and then went to the cafeteria to grab breakfast. He ate <del>his favorite food, Katsudon</del> a healthy omelet. </p>
                <p><del>The cafeteria was full. He sat next to his friends Shoto, Ochako, Tenya, and Kacchan, who were eating all their favorite foods for breakfast, too. He ate the katsudon. It wasn’t as good as the one his mom used to make, but it was still very good. </del></p>
                <p><del>The first subject of the day, after homeroom, was hero studies – the students would need to eat well and have a lot of energy for training in Ground Gamma! </del></p>
                <p>The cafeteria was mostly empty, since it was breakfast time. Izuku sat by himself, scrolling through his phone and looking up the latest hero news on social medias. </p>
                <p>Another girl also sat by herself in another table, eating her breakfast while writing in her notebook. </p>
                <p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes was sitting all alone. </p>
                <p>Maybe she was in the Gen Ed course? Hero students only meet Gen Ed students during lunch periods and extracurricular activities like the culture or sports festival, so maybe that’s where Izuku had seen her before.</p>

        <p>“Y-you’re not weirded out that I wrote about you?” </p>
        <p>“Hey, I write observations about the people around me all the time. And, I can tell these aren’t ‘observations’ of me, they’re more like… ‘dications’. Like you’re telling a story,” Izuku responded. “And the fact that your ‘dications’ affected reality at all is amazing! Looks like it doesn’t matter if you type it or handwrite it either!” </p>
        <p>“I… discovered this power recently,” the girl admitted. “Nothing happened – at least I think nothing happened – when I wrote a few weird stories for fun. That was before all this happened and I ended up here in UA. But then I found myself here in the cafeteria and decided to experiment. Figure out how much I could do with my words…” </p>
        <p>“Could I read those other stuff?” </p>
        <p>She gulped. </p>
        <p>“Sure, but they’re… look, it’s gonna be cringey,” </p>

        <p>It could be a good day. </p>
        <p>Izuku woke up right before his alarm rang, and went on his morning run. He’d been sleeping in for a few days in a row, and was unable to get any exercise in before class started.  </p>
        <p>Well, the reason Izuku woke up early today was because of a headache – he thought he heard someone calling his name, but no one called his phone or stood outside his room, and he decided there was no point in going back to sleep. </p>
        <p>He jogged around campus for about an hour, and decided to eat breakfast at the cafeteria before returning to his dorm room to shower and wear his uniform. Since it was very early in the day, the cafeteria was nearly empty, save a few faculty members and students who also woke up early</p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>see now this feels more realistic.</p></div></div>
        <p>Izuku picked an omelet but decided to also have some orange juice for his headache. He took a single bite, but he felt… full.  Like he’d eaten an entire serving of katsudon already. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>yeah bc you did</p></div></div>
        <p>But that didn’t make sense? He only ate katsudon when his mom made it, and the last time he ate that was weeks ago. Maybe he should get some Katsudon for breakfast anyway, to gauge how different it tasted compared to his mom’s.</p>
        <p>Izuku looked around – he knew it was only breakfast time, but for some reason he expected more people to show up. Logically he knew that no one would eat cold soba or spicy tuna rolls for breakfast, but he couldn’t help but feel like he’d seen someone eat those foods for breakfast. Very recently. </p>
        <p>Most people who were in the cafeteria at this hour were eating alone, too tired to socialize at this hour. None of them were eating cold soba or spicy tuna rolls, but there was something familiar about the girl eating ramen for breakfast and writing in her notebook. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>ochako ate ramen for breakfast in the last loop</p></div><div class="thought white"><p>that’s not ochako though</p></div></div>
        <p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes, was sitting all alone. </p>
        <p>Maybe she was in the Gen Ed course? Hero students only meet Gen Ed students during lunch periods and extracurricular activities like the culture or sports festival, so maybe that’s where Izuku had seen her before.  </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>is it just me or is that the same girl from last loop</p></div>  <div class="thought white"><p>no i think you’re onto something</p></div></div>
        <p>The warning bell rang, signaling the start of homeroom. Everyone started walking towards the cafeteria exit, and Izuku followed suit.  </p>

        <p>Izuku’s head pounded.</p>
        <p>Maybe he should take a nap – but it would be too hard for him to fall asleep now. Classes for the day hadn’t started yet, and he did work out before coming to the cafeteria for breakfast.</p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>oh he’s gonna try to sleep now</p></div> <div class="thought white"><p>ninth! we’re right here! can you hear us?</p></div></div>
        <p>His headache was growing. There was a buzzing in his ear, almost as if he could hear something that wasn’t there. Maybe it was the aftereffects of a concussion? He’d have to get Recovery Girl to check… if it didn’t wear off after his nap. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>maybe i should copy paste the script of the entire bee movie</p></div> <div class="thought"><p>omg NO</p></div></div>
        <p>Huh? </p>
        <p>Izuku turned his head right and left, looking for the source of the noise. It sounded like there was an argument, and someone screamed “no”. He isn’t sure if he should help them resolve an argument – especially if it’s none of his business – but the cafeteria was nearly empty.</p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>do you think he heard that</p></div></div>
        <p>“I… I did hear that,” Izuku responded. “Who are you? Where are you?”</p>

        <p>The vestiges calmed down. </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>we’re the previous holders of OFA</p></div></div>
        <p>“Y-yeah, I figured as much,” </p>
        <p>The sound was gradually getting louder and clearer, almost as if the speaker was standing right behind Izuku – but no one was there. It had to be from inside his head. </p>
        <div><div class="thought"><p>did you notice something weird about the past few days? hours?</p></div></div>

        <p>It was going to be a good day, maybe even a perfect one. </p>
        <p>Izuku had gotten a full 8 hours of sleep. He pulled the covers off his bed and stretched his arms out. Ever since moving to the dorms, he didn’t need to wake up as early in order to make it on time to classes. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>you missed your morning run</p></div></div>
        <p>After a quick brush of his teeth and wash of his face, Izuku changed into his U.A. uniform and headed to the on campus cafeteria for breakfast. He had a mild headache, but it wasn’t enough to dampen his mood. He was looking forward to school today.</p>
        <p>There were a large number of students – Izuku would never find a seat if his friends didn’t save one for him. After going through all of middle school without a single friend, Izuku is thankful to have such good friends. </p>
        <p>He grabs a bowl of breakfast and makes his way to the table where his friends had saved him a seat. </p>
        <p>“Katsudon for breakfast? A healthy choice!” Tenya commented. The class president was also eating a very hearty meal for breakfast – beef stew. </p>
        <p>Izuku takes a look at everyone’s breakfast choices at his friend table – Ochaco was eating ramen, Shoto was eating cold soba; Interesting breakfast choices. </p>
        <p>Across the cafeteria, all the students – and even some faculty – were eating breakfast in groups. Some chatted while eating, others ate in silence, but everyone had a companion to eat with. No one was alone. </p>
        <p>Except for one person. </p>
        <p>A slim, lean girl in the UA uniform, with straight blonde hair that reached a little past her shoulders and bangs that covered her eyes was sitting all alone. </p>
        <div><div class="thought white"><p>bro is this some y/n self insert??</p></div></div>
        <p>Maybe it was the buzz in his head again, but Izuku felt sorry for the girl. He knew the pain of being lonely, and never wanted another to feel that pain, if he could help it. </p>
        <p>Pro heroes were career individuals who performed grand gestures of public service to save lives, but even the little, everyday actions could be heroic to a singular person.</p>
        <p>“Hey, do you think we should invite that girl over there to sit with us?” Izuku asked his friends.</p>
