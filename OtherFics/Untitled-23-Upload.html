<p>When all was said and done, the culture festival was only postponed by a day. Aizawa was no worse the wear despite being tased, and Danny was exhausted from using a lot of his quirk in succession on top of being tased. Right after the villains were secure and removed from the campus, Danny all but fainted, a mess of limbs lying on the earth.</p>

<p>“Woah Danny, get up!” Shinsou is by his friend’s side, startled.</p>

<p>“Dude, I just need a <em>nap</em>. Not even Present Mic screaming in my ear would probably wake me up,” Shinsou snickers. If Danny could make a joke like that, he was going to be all right.</p>

<p>Nighteye offers Danny a hand, which the young boy accepts and eventually sits up. “That was a lot expected out of you and your quirk; atleast let Recovery Girl take a look at you.” Nighteye just did, himself.</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah, good idea,” Shinsou helps Danny stand up, and the two shuffle to where they can sit on nearby chairs. The police and a few pro heroes are in the area, taking statements from students and doing damange and press control while they can.</p>

<p>“S-Sir!” Nightyeye is pulled out of his thoughts when Midoriya approaches him.</p>

<p>“Midoriya,”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your help! We wouldn’t have been able to succeed otherwise!” Midoriya falls into a bow. That straightforward, sort of loud, honest to a fault tone was <em>so</em> All Might.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t possible without the cooperation of you and your classmates either, Midoriya,” Nighteye acknowledges. Midoriya straightens his back.</p>

<p>“It’s happened before, hasn’t it? Preventing your vision from coming true” The hush in Midoriya’s voice causes Nigtheye to freeze. That behavior was <em>unlike</em> All Might. “Danny was the one you’d seen getting kidnapped in your vision, but that didn’t happen. We changed the future.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. The criminal was apprehended.” Nighteye straightens his glasses.</p>

<p>“You don’t deny it.”</p>

<p>“I could have lied to you about that – maybe I saw it play out exactly as it did but I didn’t tell anyone,”</p>

<p>“…That sounds like a half baked excuse,” Midoriya points out. Nighteye sighs. He and Midoriya were somewhat alike, after all – reading between the lines like that. Midoriya knew enough about Nighteye’s quirk to know that Nighteye was looking into Danny’s future when he offered Danny a hand.</p>

<p>“Is that why you decided to wear your culture festival costumes, knowing you’d have a battle today?” Nigtheye asks. He never told the students what to wear – he assumed that by involving them in battle, they’d naturally choose to wear their hero costumes; but they didn’t. They wore the black and white accented costumes that he saw in his vision regardless – funny how <em>that</em> part of his vision didn’t change.</p>

<p>Midoriya just smiles in response.</p>

<p>That made Nighteye wonder – <em>did </em>they actually avert the vision where he saw Danny getting kidnapped? The first vision cutoff right when he saw Danny briefly struggling against the villain’s chokehold. It was fragmented and vague, almost as if he was watching the vision through murky water. It seemed more incomplete, rather than incorrect. Nothing in his vision indicated the students would succeed or fail in the battle, but it spurred Nighteye into action to prepare for it...which made him think. How many orders of magnitude were involved in <em>fate</em>? Where was Nighteye in that equation? And who ranked higher?  </p>

<p>The vision Nighteye saw this time, was much better – the water wasn’t as murky, there were less fragments than before, and he could see a little further into the future before the vision cut off this time.</p>

<p>Maybe the longer Danny stays in this dimension, the more accurate his visions related to Danny will be? Nighteye’s vision of the Eight Precepts was the only time he was glad to be so disasterously wrong – if it could be called that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><hr />

<p>A visit to Recovery Girl and a nap later, Danny was significantly better.</p>

<p>Now that the show was back on the road, class 1-A could finally deliver the performance they’d worked so hard for! With <em>everyone</em> present and not a single one of them too injured or kidnapped or anything. Danny was on such a relief-high from making it through Nighteye’s vision with the best possible outcome for him and his classmates.</p>

<p>Danny’s relief high was momentarily brought down when Nighteye debriefed him privately.</p>

<p>“It’s no secret that he was after you specifically. He also mentioned Shigaraki by name. We don’t know why or how the League would have come to know of you, but it’s best to exercise caution, Danny.”</p>

<p>Aizawa's working theory was that cell phone footage of Danny fighting a Noumu - right before the police arrested Danny for vigilantism - caught the League's interest. That wasn't necessarily enough information to spur the villains into action - but Shigaraki was notoriously difficult to profile. </p>

<p>Danny nods when spoken to, and makes the active decision to file this information away for later. If he dwelt on this too long, it would ruin his mood. Besides, it’s not like having someone out for him personally was a new experience – there’s Vlad, Skulker, Spectra, and even Dash technically. Danny was sure he could handle one more guy. And Danny wouldn't even handle that guy alone - he'd always have the backup of his classmates, or at the very least, Aizawa-sensei. </p>

<p>Researching was a problem for later though, because it was time for the culture festival, and the concert they practiced so hard for.</p>

<p>And the concert was quite the feat – Uraraka used her quirk to make the audience float around, turning them from spectators into participants. Todoroki’s and Aoyama’s quirks turned the atmosphere into something magical – a disco ball with shining ice, suspended in the air. The main vocalists took turns singing solo or group verses a few at a time.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
  <em>They all told me I can't. They were laughing.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>Well look who's laughing now</em>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The beat drops, and the crowd goes wild. It's like this song was made for this occasion. No matter who or what stood in their way, they'd be the heroes that saved the day.</p>

<p>Danny's eyes wander, making eye contact with Eri perched on Aizawa-sensei's shoulder, among a sea of people. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
  <em>I'll be your hero, No one's gonna hurt you again.</em>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her eyes and mouth widen with glee.</p>

<p>‘If anything were to happen to Eri I would kill everyone in this room and then myself,’ Danny thinks to himself. The entire class throws a peace sign, before moving on to the next song.</p>

<p>With Danny's role as a vocalist finished, he joined the audience hype. he flew out into the crowd– high fiving some of the floating audience members – stopping right in front of Aizawa-sensei.</p>

<p>“Can I borrow Eri? I’ll just give her a ride real quick,” Danny winks.</p>

<p>“She thought you’d never ask,”</p>

<p>Danny picks up the white haired girl and cradles her tight, flying slowly through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Are you enjoying yourself, Eri?”</p>

<p>Her smile says it all. It wasn’t the smile of a polite greeting, or a smile that hid pain. It was the smile of joy and laughter, the most genuine one to grace Eri’s face just yet. She’s never been up so high in the air before, and she likes it. She’s never gone this long without being hurt by the punctured with needles or hit by someone.</p>

<p>“It’s so cool!” She says.</p>

<p>Danny could feel his heart melting with joy. Eri’s like…a little sister to him. </p>

<p>“Eri, do you want to meet the other guys who were in the concert?” Danny asks. She was comfortable enough to wave at the other floating audience members, so now was as good a time as any to try.</p>

<p>“Y-Yes,” The stutter doesn’t escape Danny’s notice, so he decides to let her start with faces she’s familiar with – Midoriya. Then, Kirishima, Uraraka, Asui – they helped rescue her. Then, one by one, the rest of the class, after the concert had finished. Eri was quiet - not only from shyness, but also because she was <em>star struck</em>.</p>

<p>“Glad you’re still here!” Midoriya appeared from behind the flock of his classmates. “I bought a snack from another class’s stall that I thought Eri would like,”</p>

<p>Eri’s face lights up when she sees the candied apple. She’s seen it before in the books in the hospital and really wanted to try one.</p>

<p>“Ack! Midoriya that’s cheating! Bribing her with food to become her favorite like that!” Ashido complains.</p>

<p>“If I’d known that she’d like that, I would’ve made some using my quirk!” Yaoyorozu mourns.</p>

<p>“And cause inflation? Not in my economy,” Satou retorts. “I’m the best baker in our class, if you want to try any new foods, you can always ask me, Eri!”</p>

<p>“Hmmm!”</p>

<p>Eri is so busy with her candied apple, no one’s sure she even noticed the arguments.</p>

<p>“It’s so tasty!”</p>

<p>“Glad to see she’s enjoying herself,” Aizawa-sensei walks over to where his students have grouped. “I was worried it would be too much for her all at once,” The students are aware that she was rescued from the The Eight Precepts hideout, but only those directly involved in the battle know that she was rescued prior to the raid.</p>

<p>“What do you want to do next, Eri?”</p>

<p>“Eat another apple!”</p>

<p>A chorus of chuckles ripples through the class 1-A students; Eri was already almost done with the apple in her hand!</p>

<p>“Alright, let’s go for it!” Danny offers her a hand, which she takes. A few of the other students – along with Aizawa-sensei – follow Danny and Eri, as they walk the festival grounds, taking in the attractions made by each of the other classes and departments. Eri discovers that she likes chocolate dipped bananas but does not like chocolate dipped strawberries. Eri wins a teddy bear at a carnival shooting game – though it would be more accurate to say Aizawa-sensei won the teddy bear for her.</p>

<p>Danny, Eri, and as many 1-A students that could fit into a photobooth took ridiculous selfies. There were awkward jabs and blinks, but each take showed Eri laughing, smiling wider than the shot before.</p>

<p>Eri hadn’t spent long touring the culture festival, but had an entire day’s worth of fun in such a short time. Perhaps it was a lot for her all at once. Not long after they came out of the photobooth, she asked Aizawa-sensei to carry her, then laid her head on his shoulder to rest.</p>

<p>“I’ll take her in to rest in Recovery Girl’s office,” Aizawa-sensei says, turning around to walk in the other direction. “The rest of you, go enjoy your day. You’ve deserved it,”</p>

<p>“What about you, sensei?” Midoriya asks.</p>

<p>“I’m probably going to take a nap, too,”</p>

<p>But he didn’t even take a class selfie with them!</p><hr />

<p>The remaining students drift off into their own groups, checking out the different events that interested them. Danny goes to visit the Support Department’s Invention Symposium, finding Midoriya, Iida, and Uraraka already there.</p>

<p>“Oho! Hello hero students!” The unmistakable sound of Hatsume’s voice rings out. “Come see some of my newest babies! I have a couple you might like!”</p>

<p>Oh boy.</p>

<p>“The Air Force gloves are great, Hatsume! I could have waited till now to pick them up but I’m glad I was able to use them earlier!” Midoriya exclaims. The Air Force gloves improved Midoriya’s adaptability in combat, which he got to test out a little bit in their fight against Gentle just yesterday. He couldn’t wait to try it some more in training.</p>

<p>“Of course I would for my favorite customer!”</p>

<p>Uraraka is seething in quiet jealousy, but Hatsume doesn’t notice.</p>

<p>“And for you, Uraraka, I thought you’d gain more mobility with your quirk by trying out a jet pack!” She hands Uraraka a mini backpack, before Uraraka could protest.</p>

<p>“A-are you sure? H-How much will it cost?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t cost anything! Yet! Because you heroes are my free test subjects!”</p>

<p>Uraraka gulps.</p>

<p>“And for you, Iida! These shoes with high friction heels should let you have better control of your speed! Especially for tight turns and corners!”</p>

<p>“T-Thank you,”</p>

<p>“And Danny! I thought it was very interesting that your hair changed color because of your quirk and was part of your hero costume,” Hatsume turns to Danny, “so I tried to develop this temporary hair coloring spray that other heroes could use! It could help separate civilian identities from hero personas even better!” Hatsume shakes a can of compressed hair spray, and sprays it over her hair; it turns an uneven white color, with specks of glitter on it.</p>

<p>“But it’s still a work in progress, ehehe. I’m trying to infuse this spray with natural vitamins and minerals too, and maybe it could be marketed to the general public after that,”</p>

<p>“Wow, that’s cool,” Danny says. So many people he’s met already have outrageous hair styles and colors, he never considered that a support item could conceivably be marketed towards the general public.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, try out this utility belt!” she shoves a long white belt with bulky pockets into Danny’s hands.</p>

<p>"But I can't even -!"</p>

<p>“For now, it comes equipped with smoke bombs, since you seem to use a smokescreen as your go to sneak attack. We can always add more support items later! Smoke bombs are the only item you can add to your arsenal without filling out paperwork!”</p>

<p>Smoke bombs...they could prove useful. And the belt’s look and color didn’t even clash with his ghost form.</p>

<p>“All you heroes, use these items and let me know what you think of them!” Hatsume waves them off with another salute before attending to a new set of <strike>guinea pigs</strike> customers.</p>

<p>“She’s…quite overwhelming,” Iida finally says.</p>

<p>“I can never get used to it,” Midoriya admits.</p>

<p>“Last time I met her, PowerLoader kinda kept her focused and on track. Guess he must be letting her loose for the culture festival, huh” Danny observes.</p>

<p>Danny’s group eventually met up with their other classmates when they met at class 1-B’s play. It was a comedic crossover of several modern and classic literatures – some that Danny was familiar with, and some that were new to him.</p>

<p>The play’s storyline was hard to follow, but the costumes were very well made. The performances were outlandishly cartoonish, and they had the whole audience laughing within minutes. The actors and the audience had a fun time – Danny wouldn’t be surprised if the actors were improvising as they were going along, the play was that <em>wild</em>.  </p>

<p>“How did you like our performance, class 1-A?!” Monoma asks the group of class 1-A students who had stayed behind. “Hah! I bet it was better than your little concert,” His smug grin takes up his entire face.</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah, your performance was world class!” Danny responds with faked enthusiasm. “You should be an actor I’m sure you’d be great!” Monoma could only stutter.</p>

<p>“Wow, I’ve never seen Monoma that quiet before,” Kaibara whispers, while watching his classmate shuffle away.</p>

<p>“Just give him what he wants at the moment, and he’ll realize that might not actually <em>be</em> what he wants,” This approach only sometimes worked on Dash, and Monoma was no threat compared to Danny’s old bully.</p>

<p>“Neat idea. Having Kendo karate chop him is getting old,”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some pleasantries later, Danny finally arrives at class 1-C’s haunted house. The decorations were extremely well made, and they did a good job of setting an eerie mood. Danny was determined not to be scared – it was just makeup and decorations and costumes, it wasn’t <em>real</em>. He could handle a few jump scares and streamers in his face.</p>

<p>Shinsou really was a natural, but the makeup and costuming definitely helped. Danny couldn’t help but shriek and turn invisible when a vampire Shinsou jumped right in front of him.</p>

<p>“Hehe, gotcha,” Shinsou broke character to chide Danny. “You aren’t even halfway through the house yet,”</p>

<p>“Shinsou these decorations are amazing!” Midoriya starts, notebook in hand. Thank goodness for his enthusiasm. “What fabrics did you use for these curtains and props? And how did you make this blood so realistic?”</p>

<p>“Why would you assume the blood is fake?” Shinsou resumes his character, speaking with a sinister voice, “There’s enough walking blood banks to get real blood from anywhere,” With a cackle, Shinsou retreats into the shadows.</p>

<p>Now Midoriya is scared, too. His mind knows that none of this is real, but the lighting and props are so well done, his heart is racing a mile a minute.</p>

<p>“D-Danny, could you turn intangible and just fly out of here. A-and then send help?” Midoriya is hiding behind Danny.</p>

<p>“N-No way m-man, th-that’s cheating!”</p>

<p>“C-Come on, guys, we can make it through the end,” Iida’s stutter does not help their group confidence.</p>

<p>“You’re all a bunch of scaredy cats,” Uraraka facepalms. “Some of the props look pretty good but it’s not even <em>that</em> scary.”</p>

<p>“Then lead the way out of here!”</p>

<p>“My pleasure,” She makes a beeline towards the end of the hall and makes a sharp right, not stopping at any of the jump scares or props. Midoriya, Iida, and Danny run to catch up, afraid of being left behind.</p>

<p>“Where would you be without me?” Uraraka asks the group when they finally make it outside.</p>

<p>“Dead!” Iida and Midoriya respond with equal fervor.</p>

<p>“Heh, I’m halfway there,” Danny responds with a chuckle. Midoriya grimaces.</p>

<p>“Get it? Because my quirk is Ghost? And ghosts are dead peo– whatever, never mind.”</p>

<p>“Nice to see you all in one piece on the other side,” Shinsou approaches the group of 1A students, still in costume. Not so scary in broad daylight, and easier to tell that it was fake.</p>

<p>“Told you, you were a natural,” Danny gives Shinsou a light elbow jab.</p>

<p>“He’s right! Your performance was really good, I was quaking!” Iida compliments the gen ed student.</p>

<p>“Seems like your other friend is unconvinced,” Everyone looks in Uraraka’s direction.</p>

<p>“No he’s right, your performance was good,” Uraraka adds, “I’ve just seen enough horror movies that jump scares just don’t do it any more. Probably a good thing?”</p>

<p>“Fair point,” That immunity to horror would’ve helped Danny during his recon of The Eight Precepts hideout. But that was <em>real</em>. And despite his squeamish stomach, Danny <em>still</em> succeeded in rescuing Eri and she had a good time today.</p>

<p>Despite the horrors of the past – or, inspite of the horrors of the past – the present turned out so much better than he would have ever thought it could.</p>

<p>“Speaking of which, how have you guys been doing since yesterday?” Shinsou asks the group of 1-A students. “You know, after what happened on campus.”</p>

<p>“A little tired, but I wanted to check out every stall in the culture festival before taking a real rest,” Uraraka pumps her fists. “I wanted to check out the Business Department’s Butler Café!”</p>

<p>“Incredibly relieved,” Danny answers truthfully. “I’m just glad that whole thing is done and over with and I can have some fun,”</p>

<p>Iida nods in agreement.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I would have enjoyed the festival if any of my classmates were hurt badly – or kidnapped – during yesterday’s battle. We couldn’t have succeeded without Sir Nighteye’s warning and everyone’s cooperation.” Iida adds.</p>

<p>“But I did notice some stares,” Uraraka adds. “People have been giving us weird looks all day,”</p>

<p>“Really? I didn’t notice,” Danny was too busy enjoying his first culture festival.</p>

<p>“Have you guys checked the news lately? The internet’s going crazy over what happened yesterday,” All of them nod no – in between culture festival prep, then the uncertainty of canceling the culture festival to deal with a villain, there’d been no time.</p>

<p>“But, I thought there’d be a media blackout regarding the incident,” Iida ponders. <em>Like Hosu</em> he thinks silently.</p>

<p>“Kinda hard to do that when the bad guy was live streaming the whole thing,”</p>

<p>Oh yeah.</p>

<p>Midoriya hadn’t gotten a chance to check his usual internet lurks for hero news the past few days. He only used his phone to call his mom to let her know they were all ok after the battle, but didn’t have time to guage media reaction to yesterday’s…<em>event</em>.</p>

<p>He opened his twitter account, which he only now realized was blowing up with notifications that he hadn’t seen earlier. Then double checks what is currently trending on herostan twitter and other social media sites, and Midoriya's jaws drop. The internet had gone crazy.</p>

<p>PRESS RELEASE: Follow Up to Villain invasion on UA's Musutafu Campus</p></div><br />
In the early morning hours of UA's Xth annual Culture Festival, a rank C criminal known as "The Gentle Criminal" invaded UA's campus. UA's culture festival is a critical time in the school's illustrious history: many students would be out and about, preparing their stalls and attractions for their parents, friends, and fellow peers to visit.

<p>Given UA students' recent encounters with The League of Villains, the culture festival was allowed on the compromise that people living outside campus would not be allowed to attend. With the cooperation of Sir Nighteye and the aid of local hero agencies, we increased security around UA during the culture festival.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sir Nighteye's participation, UA came to know of the attack, mere hours before it occured, and indefinitely postponed the culture festival until The Gentle Criminal could be apprehended and the safety of the students and faculty was certain.</p>

<p>Since the criminal was quickly apprehended, the culture festival is due to resume tomorrow. The teacher and student who were both tased in the onset - identified as Shouta Aizawa and Danny Fenton - are under observation and expected to make a complete recovery. We are cooperating with law enforcement to draft and enforce stricter protocol for surveilance of online activity to prevent this type of blatant crime in the future.</p></div><div class="tw">
