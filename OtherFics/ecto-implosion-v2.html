    <p>A sudden “Mr. Fenton!” snapped Danny’s attention to the teacher looming over his desk.</p>
    
    <p>“Stop texting in class.” Mr. Lancer held his hand out </p>
    
    <p>“I’m not texting!” </p>
    
    <p>Danny lifted both his hands on top of his desk, flipping it back and forth to show that there really was no phone in his hand. The teacher was taken aback – no desk cubby to slip his phone in, no sleeves to slip the phone into, no opened zips in his backpack, no time to maneuver to his pocket. Mr. Lancer had confiscated Danny’s phone a number of times in class, so he was aware of the student’s creative hiding places. It would take him time to find this newest one. </p>
    
    <p>“Alright, then can you answer question number 3?” </p>
    
    <p>Danny didn’t even know what page they were supposed to be on. But a puff of cold air and a shiver down his back told him it didn’t matter anymore. </p>
    
    <p>“Actually, I have to go to the bathroom!” </p>
    
    <p>“Using the bathroom to escape class participation?” </p>
    
    <p>Danny was already halfway to the door. </p>
    
    <p>“It’s just… I really gotta go! It’s a really bad emergency!” Naturally, he ran out of class without a hall pass.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Danny put his phone in his pocket and immediately transformed – his hair turned silver white, a black hazmat suit washed over his clothes, and he had full access to his ghost powers now. </p>
    
    <p>He flew out of the bathroom stall, letting his ghost core guide him towards his target. Previously his ‘ghost sense’ was the only power he could tap into without transforming. His ghost sense was stronger when he transformed, helping him figure out direction, the number of ghosts, and their power level.</p>
    
    <p>Danny steered himself, and came across a creature that looked like it jumped out of Doomed; Jagged stoney limbs, with muscles literally on fire and ecto-lava threading the body together. Danny briefly wondered if this ghost was a construct from a wish granted by Desiree, but his core thrummed in response to the ghost launching a fireblast at a tree – this <em>was</em> his target, a powerful one. </p>
    
    <p>Danny tapped into his core, drew upon some ice from the freezer, and shot a beam at the burning tree to put the fire out. </p>
    
    <p>“Hey hot head, why don’t you just <em>chill out, </em>the temperature is a record high today.” </p>
    
    <p>The ghost roared, and then launched a large, fiery ball of molten rock toward Danny – he caught it and froze it in his hands using his ice power, but he could feel the heat emanating from the ghost as he got closer.</p>
    
    <p>“Oh gosh, is the heatwave <em>your</em> fault? Dude, way to prove my p– the <em>Fentons</em> right about blaming random weather problems on ghosts! You’re making a bad name for all of us!” </p>
    
    <p>He zoomed down, wrapping up the now frozen ice ball in his hands with more layers of ice, and used his momentum to launch the icy ball back. Bits of molten ecto-lava fell off the ghost’s body as it flew around, melting stinky potholes on the road below. </p>
    
    <p>Maybe Danny could deal with the road and the ghost at the same time, with a clone. His cloning ability wasn’t the best, but if he could somehow distract the fiery ghost’s attention away from flammable material, he could work on icing things up – just so that the town isn’t <em>too</em> mad at the inevitably large amounts of property damage. </p>
    
    <p>It took Danny a count of fifty-five seconds to create a stable ghost clone – awfully long in a fight, but doable because the golem ignored him. Unfortunately, the amount of property damage in those fifty-five seconds amounted to ecto-lava slowly streaming across the road, and some grass on fire. The clone (a weaker copy of himself) went off to distract the golem while Danny (the original) tried to repair the ecto-lava damage on the roads. He maybe froze over a grand total of two potholes before a sickening splat of ectoplasm told him his clone was flattened by a large lava-bouldery hand.</p>
    
    <p>He shuddered. He had instructed his clone to try hand-to-hand combat – to occupy the fiery golem-ghost’s full attention. Danny knew it wasn’t an effective strategy, but he didn’t expect it to be so short-lived either. </p>
    
    <p>Danny himself tried a few punches and kicks of his own, but the golem burned his skin on impact. He took off a glove to inspect his hand – swollen – and he was sure his feet would feel the same. He tried some ecto-beams, but the large bulky ghost was surprisingly adept at dodging long-range attacks. </p>
    
    <p>His ice powers were the only effective way of dealing any damage to the fire golem. He dissolved his legs into a ghostly tail and immediately came up with an idea. </p>
    
    <p>“Hey Lava-brain!” Danny taunted. “Did you get <em>fired</em> from your job, and decide to take out on all of us?” </p>
    
    <p>The golem roared, taking the bait and returning his attention to Danny.</p>
    
    <p>“Aww, it’s no fun when they don’t talk back,” </p>
    
    <p>The golem threw a rocky fist into Danny’s abdomen – but he was expecting it, and morphed his body around it. The fist went through empty air, with the ectoplasm making up Danny’s body floating distorted in the air around it. He prepared his ice core for the inevitable impact and then contorted his ectoplasm back to its original shape – snagging the golem’s arm inside him. </p>
    
    <p>“Oh, I really hoped that would stomach chop your arm off.” Sweat started beading his brow. “Guess I gotta do it myself.” </p>
    
    <p>His ice core started working overtime to counter the lava limb trapped in his body; a heatwave was trying to melt him from the inside, but not if Danny could freeze it first. </p>
    
    <p>Danny called upon his ice even more, pooling it at his stomach and his arms, and projecting it forward. His core was like his heart – it told him when he was in danger, it kept his body alive (or, whatever he was), it held his hopes and dreams. He screamed as he pulled into his core, pulled out as much <em>ice</em> as he could, and blasted it forward indiscriminately. Once upon a time, he had too much ice – now Danny hoped he had enough. </p>
    
    <p>Danny wasn’t sure how much time had passed, or if had any ice left, when he felt a weight shift in his stomach. The crumbling started with the arm phased into his stomach. Cracks appeared everywhere on the golem’s no longer flaming body, veining outward until they met, and the entire boulder crumbled instantly. Beads of ectoplasm melted out of the rock shards, congealing to find each other and stay whole. The ghost’s core was damaged, incapable of holding its form together or producing any more fire. </p>
    
    <p>Danny hadn’t seen liquid ectoplasm behave like that before, gooping together in an attempt to maintain form. No body remained behind to hold the ghost either. Danny sucked in the ectoplasm using his Fenton thermos.</p>
    
    <p>“For once, there’s real soup in here, huh?” </p>
    
    <p>Danny didn’t know what came first – the hot weather, or the fire core ghost – but he hoped the temperature would cool down, even if just a little. It was scorching hot. </p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <p>The ice cream helped, just a little – not only against the hot weather, but to replenish Danny’s energy.</p>
    
    <p>“You did <em>what</em>?!” Sam whispered in an angry hiss. </p>
    
    <p>They’d gotten their promised ice cream after school, at the mall. His hoodie got a few odd stares, but it was what Sam and Tucker had seen him wearing at school, and it helped hide the burnt swelling on his hand that had transferred to his human half.</p>
    
    <p>“It’s like combining cloning with… whatever happens to my feet when I get a ghost tail? I cut my ghost body in half, but not all the way, then bring it back together to trap his arm in me.” </p>
    
    <p>Sam and Tucker still glared back at Danny.</p>
    
    <p>“I’d been practicing something like it, so I knew it was possible!” He hadn’t been practicing it in front of them, though.</p>
    
    <p>“Okay, but it looked like you got donut-skewered back there, Rengoku-style” Tucker responded. “We thought it was <em>bad</em>.” </p>
    
    <p>Danny was already pale as a ghost, but he’d come out of that fight looking paler than a vampire. It wasn’t easy for Danny’s friends to see him with a punch through his gut and hear him yell a blood-curling scream – even if he claimed that it wasn’t a scream of pain, but a yell of ‘concentrating power’. </p>
    
    <p>“Besides,” Sam said, “What if you didn’t mold your ghost body back together correctly? How would that affect your human form? You could have internal bleeding and we wouldn’t even know!” </p>
    
    <p>“Well, the blood is inside, that’s where it’s supposed to be, so it’ll be fine!” </p>
    
    <p>“No wonder you’re failing bio.” </p>
    
    <p>It’s true, but that’s what made it funny. He ate his ice cream slowly, savoring the peace that came with each bite. </p>
    
    <p>His stomach churned knots while eating dinner – maybe pizza and ice cream on the same day wasn’t a good idea. </p>

    <hr />
    
    <p>Danny woke up early the next day – not because of his ghost sense, but because of his wet sheets. He freaked out for a second, wondering if he’d somehow accidentally peed in his sleep for the first time since he was seven, but his entire body was wet, not just his pants. </p>
    
    <p>He was drenched in sweat, and he wiped his face on his sleeve, it turned green<em>.</em> His body was leaking green sweat, just like the way he was sweating yesterday fighting the golem ghost. His hands were still swollen from the burns. </p>
    
    <p>He sighed as he washed his face and hands. He <em>hoped</em> his healing factor would have reduced the swelling and peeling in his hand overnight, but it looked the same as yesterday. It wouldn’t be easy to hide like a bruise, unless… </p>
    
    <p>…unless Danny transformed or shapeshifted just his hand? Just like his ghostly tail, just like his ghostly body trick from yesterday, could Danny use his ghost powers to rearrange a part of his <em>human</em> body? He could theoretically control the ectoplasm in his body at a cellular level – direct it to any part of his body to fire in a concentrated beam, use its energy to amplify his own physical strength, and call upon its unique properties to physically alter a part of his body. If he could alter his body to trap a ghost into an ab chop, could he partially transform his hand, just to heal it? Or make it <em>look</em> like it was healed? </p>
    
    <p>He called upon his ectoplasmic core – dimmed but not dormant in his human form – and willed the ectoplasm to pool at his hand. He couldn’t control his blood or bones with the same level of minute control – no human could – but he could still affect its behavior with his control over ectoplasm. With a set of instructions to cool down, trim excess flesh, and change the color of his skin tone to an unburnt one, his ectoplasm set to work. </p>
    
    <p>He could feel a frostbite – a <em>cold</em> burn – in his hand, and it hurt more than expected. The minutes went by agonizingly slow, but his hand swelled down to an acceptable size and color range.</p>
    
    <p>Danny had experimented many times with his powers before, but none of them had hurt like this. The only pain he ever got because of his powers were injuries that other ghosts inflicted on him. What was going on with his body? Beyond the usual bruises and sleeplessness,... something was not right. </p>
    
    <p>He washed and wiped off as much of the lime-green sweat from his face and body as he could. It was still pretty hot outside; too hot for his usual post-ghost fight hoodie, so he opted for a full-sleeved shirt instead. He’ll probably still sweat in it, though. He hoped no ghost would attack at school today; he barely had the energy to maintain a transformation. </p>
    
    <p>“Let me know if you want to come home early today,” Jazz said on their drive to school. </p>
    
    <p>“Why would I want to come home early?”</p>
    
    <p>“The ghost fight yesterday looked like it took a lot out of you, and you look…” Jazz stared at his face a little too long that Danny thought he would start sweating green again. </p>
    
    <p>“I’m <em>fine</em>, Jazz.” </p>
    
    <p>Danny <em>was</em> fine – for a grand total of one-and-a-half hour. While in class, something bubbled from the inside of his chest and threatened to come out of his mouth. Though that wasn’t an uncommon experience thanks to his ghost sense, this one was excessively unpleasant. Instead of a cool breeze, it was a burn in his throat. He covered his mouth and raised his hand. </p>
    
    <p>“Um.. Mr. Lancer, can I… use the bathroom?” </p>
    
    <p>“Mr. Fenton, we are in the middl–” but Lancer must’ve seen something in his face, and his tune changed. </p>
    
    <p>“Yes, you can go,” </p>
    
    <p>Maybe it was whatever Jazz had seen on his face earlier.</p>
    
    <p>Danny didn’t waste a second running out of the classroom, with the same urgency he reserved for ghost attacks. </p>
    
    <p>Two hallway bends later, Danny found the men’s bathroom – blessedly empty – and ejected the contents of yesterday’s pizza into the sink. He squeezed his eyes shut as another round of vomit bubbled up in his throat and expelled some more down the sink. Despite the burning sensation of the vomit still in his throat, the taste of dinner ghosted his tongue.</p>
    
    <p>His vomit was green. He hadn’t eaten anything vegetarian lately – despite Sam’s best efforts – so that couldn’t have come from his diet. </p>
    
    <p>It had to be from that ghost fight yesterday. He turned on the faucet and tried his best to clean the sink of his viscous puke, and distantly wondered if any sewage system was equipped to filter out ecto-vomit. He then washed his hands and face, only for the paper towels to also stain a slight green, just like this morning. Should he take up Jazz’s offer to drive him back home?</p>

    <p>He needed to get his energy up, not only to stop his friends from worrying but also in case an actual ghost did show up. He passed by a vending machine on his way back to class and intangibly stole a can of soda when no one was looking. He almost dropped the soda, feeling faint, and caught himself by leaning forward against the vending machine, taking deep breaths to help his vision clear. Danny picked up the can, popped it open, and took a big long sip, hoping the sugar rush would help him stand straight. </p>
    
    <p>He finished the can by the time he made it to class, and seriously considered going back for another one. Class had finished by the time Danny had gotten back, so he was able to pick up another soda can on the way to his next class anyway. </p>
    
    <p>“Thank goodness the school board didn’t get rid of the vending machines,” Danny took a sip of his soda. Sam and Tucker were aware of his higher metabolism, and how Danny tended to eat more after a ghost fight, so it wasn’t strange for them to see Danny snack in between classes. </p>
    
    <p>“You should pack some high calorie energy bars with you, in case they ever <em>do</em> get around to removing vending machines,” Sam said.</p>
    
    <p>“Maybe Sam’s push for more vegan options in the school lunch menu distracted them.”</p>
    
    <p>The carbonation bubbled up Danny’s nose when he snorted from laughter. If they were able to joke around him, joke with him, then they believed he was fine. </p>
    
    <p>Crisis averted. </p>
    
    <p>Though Sam and Tucker did give him worried glances when he drank two more soda cans before lunch. </p>
    
    <p>“Are you <em>sure</em> you’re okay, Danny?” Sam grabbed lunch trays for the three of them, and they all shuffled in line. “You didn’t look so great this morning, and –” Sam paused. “Yesterday couldn’t have been easy, either.” </p>
    
    <p>“What, jealous of how much soda I can down in a day?” </p>
    
    <p>“Seriously, Danny, we’re not joking,” Tucker added. “Look we know we can’t –we can’t do what you do, help out the way you do, but if you’re not honest about how you’re feeling, then we can’t help you at all,” </p>
    
    <p>“But I don’t need any help!” </p>
    
    <p>“I mean… it doesn’t have to be… <em>that</em> kind of help,” They were in the cafeteria, they couldn’t talk about Danny being Phantom openly, but the message was still loud and clear to him. “It could be… homework help, or I dunno, something stronger than Tylenol, or training, or,...whatever,”</p>
    
    <p>Danny hated asking for help, because it meant admitting weakness – and admitting weakness meant people in his life would stop him from patrolling town or fighting ghosts, and if they stopped him, then who would protect the town? He couldn’t leave the town defenseless.</p>
    
    <p>“I… really don’t need help, but, I’ll think about it,” It was a lie, but Danny hoped it would at least get Sam and Tucker off his back. </p>
    
    <p>“You don’t have to need help, but you do have to be honest,” </p>
    
    <p>Danny felt like he was caught in the middle of an uncomfortable intervention, something Sam and Tucker discussed beforehand before ganging up on him. It made him uncomfortable. </p>
    
    <p>When Danny accidentally elbowed someone on the way to an empty lunch table, something <em>lurched</em> in his core; for some reason, his lunch tray fell on the floor. Meat, pasta, and potatoes splashed on the floor, and on his clothes. </p>
    
    <p>"I… guess I do need help,” Danny said.</p>
    
    <p>Sam gave a small, tired smile. </p>
    
    <p>“I’ll get him another lunch tray. Tucker, help clean him up?” </p>
    
    <p>“Yes ma’am!” </p>
    
    <p>Danny bent down to help clean up and felt a dark wetness pooling on his right sleeve. He quickly pulled his sleeve down, thankful that he chose to wear a dark colored t-shirt to hide what was undoubtedly a growing green stain. </p>
    
    <p>“Oh dude, your sleeve is a mess,” Tucker pointed out. </p>
    
    <p>“Mystery meat, am I right?”</p>
    
    <p>Maybe his acting was better this time, because Tucker laughed in agreement. They gathered up the soiled food onto Danny’s tray as off the floor as best they could, and Danny took the tray towards the trash bin. With Tucker out of his sight for a brief moment, Danny pulled up his sleeve to look at his arm. </p>
    
    <p>His pinky was missing. It was just a bleeding green stub. </p>
    
    <p>Suddenly, Danny wasn’t hungry anymore. He grabbed tissues to stem the flow, and pulled his sleeve up – no way in hell was he letting Sam and Tucker see this. </p>
    
    <p>Despite the fact that Sam thoughtfully brought him another lunch tray – that had actual meat in it! – Danny didn’t eat much, and pretended he was just full from all the soda he drank. In reality, his right hand – his eating hand, his texting hand, his writing hand – was the hand with the mysteriously disappeared pinky, and if he tried eating, they would notice, and he didn’t want that. He wasn’t sure how or why his finger seemed to implode. It didn’t even hurt; it was just a minor inconvenience, so there was no reason for Sam and Tucker to make a big deal out of something he could eventually figure out or handle by himself. He was fine, totally. </p>
    
    <p>Danny didn’t trust himself to respond to any texts from Sam and Tucker in class without getting caught – without exposing his mysteriously missing pinky finger – so he genuinely tried to pay attention in class. Danny wrapped his sleeve tighter to hide half his fingers as he tried to take notes, trying to copy down as many equations and notes as possible, but gave up when all the letters and numbers began to swirl in his head. When he noticed that his notebook started getting green smears, he gave up note-taking altogether. </p>
    
    <p>He thought he was getting more creative with his powers. He thought he was getting stronger, smarter, and more in control, but dropping the lunch tray made him feel like he was a first-semester freshman all over again, dropping chemistry beakers because he couldn’t control his powers then. </p>
    
    <p>Maybe all wasn’t lost! Maybe he could trick his pinky finger to reform like he had tricked his hand to heal faster earlier. </p>

    <p>Truthfully, Danny didn’t want to – one more finger in his right hand had imploded, and he’d changed into another dark full-sleeved t-shirt. He had a trash bag full of ecto-stained tissues that he’d have to dispose separately without his parents knowing. But he’d deal with it, without raising any suspicions – just like he’d deal with this video chat. </p>
    
    <p>His phone rang with a notification about an incoming voice call, and his inability to say no won over his need to pretend he was okay, and he answered. </p>
    
    <p>“Hi guys!” Sam greeted. “I’m working on math homework right now, and I figured one of you two is better at the numbers game than me, so we might as well crowd source this assignment,” </p>
    
    <p>Danny angled the camera away from his face, and responded with a totally not suspicious “hey!”. He was barely gripping his pencil with his remaining two fingers and thumb. An ecto-stained tissue was wrapped around his hand to hide his missing fingers and prevent the stubs from bleeding onto his paper.</p>
    
    <p>“Danny, you okay?” </p>
    
    <p>“Yeah, my room’s just a mess,” Danny’s voice was a little smoother this time, “And I think I might need help with the homework too, actually,” </p>
    
    <p>“Sweet, maybe we can figure this out together!” </p>
    
    <p>Crisis averted.</p>
    
    <p>They talk through the homework assignment, pointing Danny to pages in the textbook that reference concepts and equations that he couldn’t understand, helping him make sense of the number and word salad that was spat out in class today. He made much more progress than if he attempted to do his homework alone, or if he’d just copied and pasted one of their answers. </p>
    
    <p>“Thank goodness there were no ghost attacks all day today, or I’d never get any of this homework done,” Danny said. </p>
    
    <p>“Wait, then what about earlier today when Lancer let you go to the bathroom and you told us it was a –” </p>
    
    <p>“Hey wait, you’re saying that wasn’t a ghost?” </p>
    
    <p>“I <em>told</em> you he was lying, you should’ve checked on him in the bathroom after all!”</p>
    
    <p>“Guys!” Danny finally showed his face on camera. “Guys it’s fine! Okay I admit it, I wasn’t feeling too hot this morning, and I lied about it because I didn’t want to worry you guys,” </p>
    
    <p>“Okay but that means you have to tell us every time you aren’t feeling well from now on, no hiding it,” Tucker said. “Like, we can do simple things like get our cover stories consistent, or give you alibis, or whatever.”</p>
    
    <p>“You think by not telling us anything, you aren’t worrying us, but not telling us anything is making us worry even more,” Sam said. “We’re gonna worry about you no matter what, hiding anything won’t make us feel better,” </p>
    
    <p>And that… got Danny thinking. Maybe he should have taken Jazz’s offer to drive him back home earlier today – maybe he <em>can</em> take that offer next time. Maybe he should tell Sam and Tucker how very unwell he’s <em>still </em>feeling<em>. </em>What if he continues to lose fingers until he can’t hide it anymore and his parents and other people will start asking questions? </p>
    
    <p>He better work on a cover story with Sam and Tucker, right now.</p>
    
    <p>“Um, so this morning, about my hand,” Danny started. “You remember how it was burnt and swollen yesterday?” He shifted his right hand to show on camera. Tucker and Sam gasped at the ecto-stains showing on the tissue wrapped around his hand. </p>
    
    <p>“So I dunno exactly what happened, but now it’s…” he unwrapped his hand and held his breath. Danny thought he might have accidentally muted the audio, but Sam and Tucker’s expressions said more than any words could. Danny tried to break the silence.</p>
    
    <p>“It doesn’t actually hurt? I didn’t even notice it, but I don’t know why it happened either,” </p>
    
    <p>“...Danny what the fuck?”</p>
    
    <p>And somehow, that was worse than anyone yelling at him.</p>
    
    <p>“No it’ll be fine! See, I was able to heal my hand before, I can do it again! I just gotta –” Danny scrunched up his face in concentration. If he figured this out right, his finger should grow back. He’d have to partially clone his hand and merge it, then reshape his finger, then –</p>
    
    <p>His middle finger imploded. Sam started yelling and Tucker started crying. </p>
    
    <p>“I can fix it! Let me just try again!” </p>
    
    <p>He reached again into his ghost core – it was normally like a freezer, but this time it felt like a tiny ice cube. He’s felt his core fluctuate many times – sometimes it was the Arctic, sometimes it was a snowman – but he never knew what it meant. This didn’t feel right. He pulled energy from the ice cube, and felt it melt. </p>
    
    <p>His shirt sleeve collapsed as his right arm imploded. Ectoplasm splashed on his homework, his desk, and his cheek. That’d be a pain to clean up. </p>
    
    <p>He’d probably make a Fullmetal Alchemist joke right about now if his friends weren’t crying, but Sam and Tucker told him to be honest and he wasn’t in pain! Honestly! He wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, though. But he was scared. He wanted his arm back! He couldn’t become left-handed, he’d never hear the end of it from others at school, and worse – would it show up in his Phantom form? Would people connect the dots between him and Phantom? Would his <em>parents</em> connect the dots between him and Phantom? </p>
    
    <p>He slipped and fell onto the floor, his knee dissolving from the impact. If Tucker and Sam were saying anything, he couldn’t hear it – at some point, his headphones had fallen off and a tickling sensation had covered his entire body. He tried to reach out to the door, but felt the soft texture of blanket instead. When he looked down he saw that there was no hand to his left. He heard the door to his room open, but he couldn’t lift his head to look. When did he hit the floor? Someone called his name, but he couldn’t say anything back. </p>
    
    <p>Why was his voice not working?? His hands, his feet, his –!</p>
    
    <p>And <em>that</em> – that he was no longer in control of his body, the core of his life – was the scariest of all. </p>
    
    <p><img class="dp-ei-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mystyrust/quaranteen/master/Images/EI/danny_melt_1.png" />
    </p>
    
    <p>All his emotions were heated to a boil. He was 2 teaspoons of shame, 3 cups of frustration, 2 quarts of avoidance, a dash of depression, and a tablespoon of frustration – all cooked in a base of anxiety. The embarrassment was what he could taste the most – what if someone figured out just how little control he <em>really</em> had over his powers, how much of a fraud he was. A fraud of a human, and a fraud of a friend.</p>
    
    <p>But then, someone added cool reassurance to the soup, and Danny found himself calming down. He opened his eyes – he still had those! – but he couldn’t see anything. He heard someone say his name. </p>
    
    <p>“ –ny? Is it cold enough? Can you hear us?” </p>
    
    <p>“Maybe drop some more ice cubes in there,”</p>
    
    <p>Huge chunks of compassion, empathy, and solace came into Danny’s soup – he could no longer taste the embarrassment. </p>
    
    <p>“Danny? Are you awake?” </p>
    
    <p>“Five more minutes,” Danny joked. </p>
    
    <p><img class="dp-ei-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mystyrust/quaranteen/master/Images/EI/danny_melt_2.png" /></p>
    
    <p>There were clamors of voices from <em>somewhere</em>, before a quiet fell. </p>
    
    <p>“Danny? Think you can get out of there?” </p>
    
    <p>Where was ‘there’? He felt around for his arms and legs and found them – though he couldn’t see them. He reached his hands around and felt them touch a wall, a floor, a ceiling. It was compact, but not uncomfortable. He couldn’t tell if he was in his ghost form or not, and his hands were formless like his tail was formless. </p>
    
    <p>“Holy shit I’m in the thermos,” </p>
    
    <p>“Yeah, your core – you, um. Why don’t you come out first?” </p>
    
    <p>Danny reached into his core, and instead of the melting ice cube he felt earlier, he found a bowl of ice cream. He’d seen his core have this type of form before, and drew upon its power. His arms and legs solidified, and he was ejected out of the thermos and into his bedroom, landing face-first onto his bed. </p>
    
    <p>“Ugh, what happened?” </p>
    
    <p>He was smothered by three pairs of hugs when he turned around. Jazz, Tucker, and Sam had puffy red eyes, as if they’d been crying. Whatever made them upset, it was obviously his fault. </p>
    
    <p>“Your core, it–” </p>
    
    <p>“You could have permanently destabilized, Danny. We almost <em>lost</em> you.” </p>
    
    <p>What even <em>was</em> core destabilization? Danny was sure his body was more stable than most, due to his human body anchoring his ghost half. And his powers were growing and his control over his powers was better (until recently). </p>
    
    <p>“But what would have made my core destabilize?” </p>
    
    <p>“Overuse.” Jazz said.</p>
    
    <p>“I think that fire golem ghost was what did it,” Tucker added. “Especially when you consider that your core is an ice-type and that ghost’s core was a fire-type,” </p>
    
    <p>Danny remembered – that ghost turned into goop, and he sucked it up quickly in the Fenton Thermos. By the time he released it into the ghost zone, it was a fully formed ghost again. Is that what ‘core destabilization’ is? Turning into ecto-goop? </p>
    
    <p>Is that what happened to him? </p>
    
    <p>Apparently they’d contacted Frostbite, who told them to cool Danny’s core temperature down as fast as possible. If dunking their cocktail of ecto-dejecto ice cubes into the thermos (after sucking up whatever remained of Danny on the floor) hadn’t worked, Frostbite would have come himself, regardless of any risk of alerting the elder Fentons. The kids were already pushing their luck, with the Doctors Fenton out of the house continuing their work on the town’s ecto-lava cleanup. </p>
    
    <p>Then… why did this happen? What if he’d melted at school? Or what if he melted all alone, with no one knowing what happened to him or where to find him? Danny isn’t sure which would have been worse.</p>
    
    <p>“Do you think you’re some goddamn hero when you shoulder it all yourself?” Jazz wiped away fresh tears. “Are we just <em>liabilities</em> to you? Is that it?” </p>
    
    <p>“No, I’m–” </p>
    
    <p>Maybe Danny shouldn’t have come out of the thermos. Maybe he should have stayed a pile of goo on the floor.</p>
    
    <p>“I just – I didn’t want to worry anyone,” Danny’s voice hitched as tears fell down his face. “I’m sorry,”</p>
    
    <p>Danny didn’t think so little of his friends and family. He thought highly of them. They were accomplished and amazing and at heights he couldn’t possibly hope to achieve, and he didn’t want to ruin any of that. Danny didn’t want to drag them into sleepless nights and bad grades because they were all chasing ghosts with him – he could deal with that himself, so that they didn’t have to. </p>
    
    <p>But that was the point, wasn’t it? That he can’t – shouldn’t – do it all himself. Trying to shoulder it alone literally caused him to implode and melt. In between the angry yelling and teary hugs, they set a rule. No “I’m fine”s. No lying or being vague about any injuries or tiredness – and that went for everyone, not just Danny.</p>
    
    <p>“You can lie to Lancer, and I’ll help cover with Mom and Dad, but no lying to <em>us</em>,” </p>
    
    <p>“...Got it,” Danny laughed. </p>
    
    <p>“Let’s practice – Danny, how are you feeling right now?” </p>
    
    <p>“I’m fine – I am! But I… I’m glad I have my arms and fingers back,” </p>
    
    <p>“We could have helped you if you told us earlier, at the first finger,” Sam said.</p>
    
    <p>“...yeah,” </p>
    
    <p>“We could start training so that we can help you in fights or something,” Tucker added.</p>
    
    <p>“What!” </p>
    
    <p>“Then you won’t have to overuse your core!” Jazz held Danny’s hand. “Then I won’t have to discover my brother dissolved into a pile of goo,” </p>
    
    <p>“But if you guys get hurt –” </p>
    
    <p>“You get hurt all the time! I’d rather one bruise on each of us than four bruises on you!”</p>
    
    <p>“I’d rather <em>no</em> bruises on <em>any</em>body!” </p>
    
    <p>“That’s what training’s supposed to help with!”  </p>
    
    <p>If Danny had his way, they’d be training for <em>months</em> before joining him for any ghost fight. They’d also need some protective gear to absorb any impact, some masks or costumes that they can easily change into, to hide their identity – oh, maybe some code names? Danny literally just used his name; Sam, Tucker, and Jazz could be way more creative than him. They all knew <em>some</em> type of first-aid, but they’d have to figure out ways to practice it with dummies – maybe Frostbite could help with that. </p>
    
    <p>“Okay,” Danny finally agreed. He’d just work extra hard to protect them, so that they can protect him while he’s protecting them, protecting him, so that— whatever, it just meant he wasn’t gonna do this alone. </p>
    
    <p>It <em>would</em> be okay.</p>
