<p class="steps-result step1">The glowing boy with white hair and a black jumpsuit got the coffee from your table and gave it to you. You didn’t think that would actually work, but it did. His eyes glow red, the same red as your staff. </p>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>

<p class="fic-steps step2"><u>“Do 30 Jumping Jacks” ==></u></p>

<p>The boy immediately starts the exercise in place. You watch him do each one – and when he hits thirty, he stops. </p>

<p>So, complicated tasks that require mental awareness are possible. You expected as much.</p>

<p>His eyes are still red, body idle but waiting for your next command. </p>
