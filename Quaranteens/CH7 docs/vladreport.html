        <span class="notes-header">Observations and notes taken while attempting to create a sentient and self sustainable half ghost clone </span><br>
        <sup> see other <span class="redacted">Vlad co</span>&nbsp;documents for equipment purchased and used </sup><br><br>
        
        <span class="underline">Attempt 1:</span><br>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Created a <span class="redacted">ghost</span> duplicate <span class="redacted">using my powers,</span> and ordered the duplicate to shapeshift into the a young Danny Fenton</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Duplicate failed to shape shift. Refused to shapeshift.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside"><span class="redacted">Of course part of me refused to submit myself for myself</span></span>
        <span class="bullet-inside"><span class="redacted">How can a clone-son love me if even I can't love me?</span></span>

        <span class="underline">Attempt 2:</span><br>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Created a <span class="redacted">ghostly duplicate with much less physical and mental capabilities than before</span></span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Its ability to hold my thoughts, values, and memories were questionable.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside"><span class="redacted">It's obvious that it has an inferior version of my powers instead of his.</span></span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">It's too similar to me. <span class="redacted">Is this self-cest?</span></span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">I need a blank slate</span>

        <span class="underline">Attempt 3:</span><br>
        <span class="bullet-inside">acquired Fenton dna from hair strands off a comb.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">amplified and sequenced the dna using PCR</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">replaced the dna of the HeLa cells with the sequenced Fenton dna (via CRISPr) and allowed the cells to grow</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">cell line shortly died.</span>

        <span class="underline">Attempt 4:</span><br>
        <span class="bullet-inside">bathed the dna sample in ectoplasm before PCR</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">dna seemingly more stable. HeLa cell line still died</span>

        <span class="underline">Attempt 5:</span><br>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Attempted to reanimate dead HeLa cell line with an ectoshock</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Cells began to divide and proliferate.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Injected dividing cells into a blob ghost.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Cell line proliferated.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Created several "ghosts"</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Varying levels of self sufficiency, power, stability</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside"><span class="redacted">Well they make for good minions. Reduces the mental load</span></span>

        <span class="underline">Attempt ???:</span><br>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Purchased embryonic stem cells <span class="redacted">using VladCo funds.</span></span>
        <span class="bullet-inside"><span class="redacted">Overshadowing would have been too suspicious during the acquisition. 
            Memory gaps in the the overshadowed victims would have immediately raised the alarm for ghost activity and made future acquisitions difficult.</span></span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Managed to create 1 stable half ghost embryo using the sequenced dna</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Should get more embryonic stem cells for future studies <span class="redacted">preferably from when Maddie was pregnant, if it exists.</span></span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Artificially accelerated the half ghost embryo to adolescent development.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Organism shows differentiation into a female - a closer look at the sequenced dna shows incomplete sequences and environmental impurities</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">Need to acquire a purer dna sample, preferably from spit or snot.</span>
        <span class="bullet-inside">His ghost sense will know I'm coming from a mile away <span class="redacted">perhaps possible to sneak in when he's gone, with strategically placed Fenton spy feed.</span></span>
