        <span><u>DNA analysis of Elle Fenton</u> - performed by Jack and Madeline Fenton</span><br><br>
        <span>
            Danny provided us with a partially redacted document written by the person responsible who created Elle. 
            We don't know who (a human? a ghost?) created Elle or why, but we know how. 
            <br><br>
            Any scientist worth their salt would know that using anything less than Pluripotent Stem Cells would not differentiate into a fully formed organism.
            Of course, this scientist must have broken a lot of ethical (and legal) laws to acquire 
            any amount of Pluripotent Stem cells so they must already have a few screws loose. 
            <br><br>
            Similar to the described methods, we amplified and sequenced Elle's DNA using PCR. 
            We did the same for Danny and Jazz's DNA as well, for a baseline to compare against.

        On average, full siblings possess 50% of their genes with each other. Of course, more than and less than 50% genetic similarity is possible
        (in the case of identical twins, 100% of their genes are similar). While Elle's DNA is an incomplete copy of Danny's genes, 
        she has more genetic similarity to Jazz than Danny does. This indicates that the DNA sample she originated from was most likely impure 
        - we share combs in this house and the hair could have easily been from 2 or more people.

        It is also possible that the self healing nature of Ectoplasm healed her at the molecular level, 
        filling in her missing base sequences before she was even born and allowing her to be a biological stable person. 
        There is a lot we do not know about ectophysiology and how Elle's own physiology affects her growth and development, 
        but we will continue to monitor and document for future reference.
