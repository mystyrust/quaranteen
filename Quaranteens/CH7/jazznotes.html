        <span>planned a few exercises for danny and elle to set a baseline for their abilities</span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">flight speed</span>: from casper high, to home.<br> Times: danny: 5:03 . elle: 6:05. much faster than driving. </span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">flight endurance</span>: 10 laps around amity park<br> Times: danny: 15:53 . elle: 17:45. </span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">flight mobility</span>: fly inbetween trees without phasing through them, 
            <br> avoid moving / projectile objects (dads bad aim put to good use)
            <br> danny: got hit with paint 4 times. 2 tree slams.
            <br> elle: 3 hits with paint. no tree slams.
        </span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">aim</span>: firing ecto blasts at stationary and moving objects 
            <br> danny: 68% accuracy stationary, 45% accuracy moving
            <br> elle: 79% accuracy stationary, 48% accuracy moving
        </span> <br><br>

        <span><span class="underline">healing factor</span>: 
            <br> not training related, but danny and elle went out for a walk yesterday and met valerie. 
                danny had a black eye when he came back. 
            <br> i was gonna give him meds and a cold compress but told me he didnt need them.
                black eye healed 2 hours later
        </span> <br><br>
        
        <span class="underline">post training notes</span> <br> 
        <span class="bullet-outside">elle seemed to like it when i used a sportscaster's voice</span> 
        <span class="bullet-outside">they both like it when i compare this to some anime's training arc montage</span> 
        <span class="bullet-outside">continue training, try to incorporate martial arts and duplication training later.</span>

        <span>continued training elle and dannys ghost powers.</span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">flight speed</span>: from casper high, to home.<br> Times: danny: 4:57 . elle: 5:05. </span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">flight endurance</span>: 10 laps around amity park<br> Times: danny: 15:13 . elle: 16:35. </span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">flight mobility</span>: fly inbetween trees without phasing through them, 
            <br> avoid moving / projectile objects - this time, sam and tucker shot at them with paint guns. they have better aim.
            <br> danny: got hit with paint 7 times. 1 tree slam.
            <br> elle: 5 hits with paint. no tree slams.
        </span> <br><br>
        <span><span class="underline">duplication</span>: create a (shadow?) clone to help assist in battle. 
            danny insists its possible and they should practice.
            <br> danny was able to create a single clone that stayed stable for 30 seconds before "releasing his hold". 
                elle managed to create one that lasted 45 seconds. 
            <br> apparently they know which ones are "real"?  
        </span> <br><br>
        
        <span class="underline">post training notes</span> <br> 
        <span class="bullet-outside">invite sam and tucker for training more often</span> 
        <span class="bullet-outside">danny and elle are motivated by the competition they give each other to improve as fast as they can</span> 
        <span class="bullet-outside">both showed a decent amount of improvement overall - though each has different strengths than the other </span>
        <span class="bullet-outside">devise training strategies for teleportation and overshadowing </span>
