        <span class="text">i do, but consider my relationship w my parents</span><br />

        <span class="text">and THEN after they adjust to that, tell them that your Phantom</span><br />

        <p><span class="dia white">Welcome to the magic show of the Fantastic Fenton, a human magician 
            capable of all sorts of feats! His final act will leave you with wonder and questions. </span></p>
    </div>

    <!-- 
        d: For my first act: observe! 
        j: A quarter! 
        d: A simple wave of the hand, and it disappears! 
        d: But if I check behind your ear, I find... a nickel!
        j: Where'd the quarter go?
        d: Check under Mom's hand.
        m: You're...right! How did you do that danny? Your sleeves are short!
        d: (Thank you ghost powers)

        d: A magician never reveals their secrets... but I'll make an exception this time. after my final trick. 
        d: For my next trick! I have assembled: an empty water bottle, an egg, and a banana.
        m: Are you going to fit the objects inside the water bottle, without breaking it?
        j: Oh I think I saw a trick like this on tiktok!
        d: You definitely have the right idea dad. I'll just -swoop- this egg in, and 
        j: It's inside the bottle!
        d: And since it's a hardboiled egg, you can swirl the bottle around all you want and the inside of the bottle will stay clean!
        j: Ooh let me try!
        m: ...there's no hole? 
        j: What do you mean?
        m: The way this trick is done is by sticking the egg in trhough a secret whole on the side of the bottle. 
            Big enough for the egg, but small enough for the audience to miss
        m: But you let us see and touch the bottle, too. 
        m: Danny, how did you-?
        d: Oh, but the trick isn't over yet, Mom! Here, let me just take that bottle back, I'll -swoop- that egg out -
        m: ..!
        j: Did you just take the egg out from the bottom of the bottle?! Did your hand just go /through/ the bottle??
        d: - And stick in this large banana. The water bottle's opening looks too small but
        d: This clear plastic bottle is big enough to hold the banana anyway! 
        d; We can solve that by turning the banana intangible, no big deal. 
        j: How did you -?
        d: Danny is this -?

        d: I'll explain, after this final trick. I promise.
        d: In my hand I have a knife. 
        j: Be careful!
        m: Danny, that better be a trick knife!
        d: Here, let me take that banana out of the water bottle
        j: ..! 
        m: ...phased it through the bottle again...
        d: And cut a few slices of the banana off. 
        d: But if I cut them thinner we can use this banana to make banana chips!
        d: So I'll cut it thinner and thinner, and -
        j: Watch your hand!
        m: Danny!
        d: Oh, the knife went right through my hand, what do you know? 
        j: Danny what type of magic show - 
        j: Wait! Your eyes!
        m: What type of ghost are you working with?!
        m: Drop that knife before I take it away from you myself!
        d: Mom! 
       // j: That would explain the coin trick too. It really WAS invisible. So you wouldn't need long sleeves.
        m: Danny let go!
        d: Mom stop that's a real knife! Careful! Ouch!
        m: Leave my son alone. Get out of his body!
        d: Mom what?
        m: I'm sorry, Danny. I'll bandage your hand as soon as the ghost leaves. 
        d: What are you-?
        m: Your eyes. They changed color and glowed when the ghost possessed you.
        d: I'm not possessed! 
        m: That's what they all say!
        j: Whatever ghost you're working with, Danny, can't be good. 
            You can't count on him to save you from every time you might cut your finger off.
            It might cut your finger off on purpose, next time.
        d: That's not what's happening!
        j: I'll get the -
        d: This went better in my head.
