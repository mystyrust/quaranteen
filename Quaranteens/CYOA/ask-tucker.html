    d: Sweet! You're already in the lab!
    j: Hey Danny! Needed something down here?
    d: Yeah! You know how a lot of your ghost weapons malfunction around me, or target me? 
    d: I might know why, and I wanted to explain it to you both
    m: oh?
    d: Yeah, let me show you with one of your tracking devices.
    d: Do you have the Fenton Boo-merang around? 
    
    j: Dismantled a while ago, to try to fix it and salvage it for parts actually.
    m: Our working theory that it registered a lot of ectoplasmic contamination and returned a false positive.

    d: Well, do you have any other inventions that you were planning to take apart? 
    d: Could try one of those.

    j: Well, there is the Fenton Bearer - never did get that one working. 
    m: It should be all the way in the back, Danny.
    d: Got it, thanks!

    d: Yeah I've never seen this one before. What does it do, turn a ghost into a bear?
    j: No, I spelled the word 'bare' wrong on it. It's supposed to
    -click'
    
    d: Ah! Where's my -? What's-!?
    m: ...Phantom?!

    j: ...show a ghost's 'bare' truth. That's what it's supposed to do...
    m: How did you-?!
   
    m: Wait is that Jack Fenton branded underwear??
    d: I'm!! I-!! It wasn't supposed to be like /this/!
    d: This is so embarassing!!
    
    m: Are you...Danny?
    j: So our inventions... always did work?

 <!-- 
    CW: aww that wasn't so bad
    d: I was dying of embarrassment! Literally!
    d: Don't tell me you weren't dying of second hand embarassment. 
    CW: Okay, I won't.
    d: I told myself I wouldn't be caught dead in that underwear! Ever! 
    d: But somehow I was! I can't believe it!
