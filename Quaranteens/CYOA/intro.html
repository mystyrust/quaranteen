<!-- intro:
    ch summary: 
    5 times Danny tried to reveal his identity to his parents + 1 time he didn't use time travel to undo it. 
    Formatted as a Choose Your Own Adventure style fic.

    notes:
    * I hope this looks good and "works"
    * This chapter will break the "Entire Work" button (sorry)
    * This chapter enforces a specific background color. If you use the default ao3 theme, your experience will be seamless.
        If you use any custom site theme, the background will change to white; you might catch on to a certain gimmick faster though...
   
    * Assuming I did this right, the "+1" route will not open until you visit all other 5 routes. 
        the "5" can be visited in any order
