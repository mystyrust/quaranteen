    d: i cant ever succeed

    j: are you okay?
    j: where are you?

    d: in my room
    j: ill come over
-->

<!-- room:
    j: Danny, is everything okay?
    d: So I've been trying to tell Mom and Dad that I'm... you know
    d: That I'm a half ghost. That I'm Phantom.
    j: And... how did it go?
    d: I've tried telling them so many times, Jazz.
    d: But I mess up, a lot. So... I used time travel to undo it.
    j: Wait you can TI-! 
    j: Nevermind. 
    j: What /have you tried so far? What happened that you had to undo it?
    d: I've tried approaching them as fenton, ive tried approaching them as phantom
    d: They keep misunderstanding or i do something wrong and then i go back in time to fix it so that i can start over again 
    d: i have to do this right. I dont want mom and dad to be embarrassed by me. 
    j: nervous
    D: Sure I've made mistakes, but I want them to be proud of me. first impressions matter, 
        and I don't want to hide this from them. 
    D: i wanna tell them i danny fenton am the ghost boy danny phantom, 
        and i dont want them to shoot at me or freak out about it. Is that too much to ask?
    -- door opens --
    d: Mom, Dad ...! How much -
    d: That was just something I was practicing for school! 
    j: That didn't sound like it was for school
    m: Are you really, ...?
    d: ...yeah
    m: And we shot at you?
    j: We... shot at Phantom. Tried to capture him all the time. 
    m: And that was you! Somehow, I don't know how!
    m: But that means we hurt you, didn't we?
    m: Oh, Danny I'm so sorry I wish we- 
    d: This is also what I was afraid of
    d: It's not your fault, it's just a misunderstanding
    d: I'll just start over and try again and -
    j: Danny wait! You don't have to start over!
    m: We are proud of you!
    j: We were never embarrassed by you.
    m: And while we still hunt ghosts, we've stopped actively hunting Phantom. We recognize the good he does for Amity Park.
    j: The actions you took as Phantom probably make more sense now that we know you were behind it.
    j: It's been months since we've hunt ghosts anyway.
    m: Oh my goodness it's been months! Danny you've been a ghost for so long!
    d: ...half ghost, actually
    m: What does that even mean?

    Jazz; danny, Mom and Dad would have freaked out a little bit when they found out, no matter what. 
    J: and that's okay. What matters is what happens after the freak out. 
    j: There's a lot we don't know about all this, but we can figure it out, together.

    d: Thanks Mom, Thanks Dad. 
    d: Speaking of together
    d: Do you think we could figure this out with a together + 1?

    m: What do you mean?

    d: I mean, there's another half ghost, and she has no where to go, so I thought
    d: It'd be nice for her to stay with us. As part of our family. 
        It'll make more sense when you meet her.

    -- a few days later --

    d: Elle, we're here
    e: Um... hi there
    j: She looks just like...! 
    m: Like Jazz when she was younger! 
    j: Like she could be your sister or cousin!
    d: And just like me, she's a half ghost too. 

    jazz; What happened to you, to turn you into a half ghost?
    e: I was born like that
    e: It's... a long story. 
    
    m: ...
    j: ...
    m: Elle, would you like to stay with us? As a Fenton?
    j: You don't have to tell us right away, how you came to be a half ghost
    j: Or at all!
    m: But whatever that means, we can stand by your side and help
    e: I'd love that! 
    d: Sorry it took me so long Elle. 
    d: Welcome home.
