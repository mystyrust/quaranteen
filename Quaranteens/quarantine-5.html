     An influx of previously alive persons and other organic mammals appear within the ghost zone ecosystem in surplus every 
     few hundred years. While ghosts are immune to bacterial and viral infections, they can - in rare cases - 
     be carriers of the disease and infect other living beings. We believe the current plague in the non ectoplasmic 
     realm to be one that can maintain its structure in ectoplasm for long periods of time. This poses a risk to any mammal 
     that gets ectoplasm into the blood stream - notably, halfas. This study aims to compile known information and provide 
     the structure and efficacy of a "vaccine" - one that imitates the mechanism of the human equivalent that targets the 
     very same virus. It is our belief that the proposed vaccine can be administered to any organism that qualifies as a 
     halfa with little to no risk. Subsequent research on this virus must accelerate, to prevent the virus from proliferating 
     and potentially evolving to harm ectoplasmic beings.

     Samples and information about the current human vaccine indicate that the vaccine is an "mRNA vaccine" - while this has 
     proven effective to killing the virus within organic cells, it will not work as a vaccine when bathed in ectoplasm. 
     It is theorized that because ectoplasm is a substance that is at a lower ambient temperature most organic mammals, 
     it can maintain its structure within ectoplasm almost indefinitely. It is worth noted that in this form, the virus is 
     incredibly difficult to transmit - only affecting another when in contact with the blood stream for long periods of time. 
     Regular humans have almost zero contact with ectoplasmic substances in their entire lifetime, but halfas are at a higher 
     risk. The authors believe that halfas should be prioritized for vaccination, before inoculating the remaining population 
     of the ghost zone. It is entirely possible that fully ectoplasmic beings have zero need for this vaccine, but administering 
     the vaccine can prevent this vaccine from 
     incorporating ectoplasm into its outer shell and later targeting non ectoplasmic beings as well. 
     <br /><br />
     One proposal is to intravenously administer a small dose of virus "heat killed" within ectoplasm. The "death echo" of the virus's death is intended to 
     imprint on the host's ectoplasmic immune system and nervous system the ability recognize the virus as an active threat. This proposed model 
     takes its form from most human vaccines, which inoculate their hosts against deadly diseases using similar mechanisms. 
     <br /><br />
     Limited clinical trials and computational models have shown that a side effect is a slightly elevated core temperature, which can be treated by with external coolants, 
     or self regulated if the host possesses an ice core.
     It is not anticipated that the virus will give anyone "new" ectoplasmic abilities, either within or outside of the ghost zone - however much the authors or audience wish otherwise.
     <br /><br />
     The expected side effect is expected to start 12 hours after administering the dose, and last up to 24-48 hours. We propose 2 doses, to mirror the human mRNA vaccine. 
     However, if a particular ectoplasmic being or halfa has unique physical health conditions, the number of doses, and the amount per dose, 
     can be changed to match their physiology. Exceptions for the standard 2 dose proposal are listed in the following section. 
     Longitudinal studies are in limited capacity but can be conducted with the permission of Clockwork. 
     Or perhaps, they are already being conducted, or have already been conducted. It is believed that, 
     because "death echos" are a subconscious mechanism that the host's body will always remember, 
     the host will remain immune to the disease they are inoculated against for as long as they exist.
