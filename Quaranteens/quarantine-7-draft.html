    danny reminds vlad that he needs a second dose
    danny offers to give the 2nd dose in exchange for dani papers
    vlad says 'did you think id inject an unknown druge into myself without analyzing it at the molecular level'
    danny: 'so you ripped it apart molecule by molecule got it'
    vlad: 'so no, you cant bargain for anything using the ghost vaccine. 
        you lost that advantage when you offered me a single dose and ive already synthesized another'
    v: i will give you no documentation on the creation of a ghost clone.

<!-- convo between danny and elle (josh fight, etc)
reference josh fight
    //todo script
    e: wow those athletes are amazing! they must train really hard
    e: we cant let up on our training either danny! 
    d: hah i bet those guys never slacked off in gym class! 
    e: i cant slack off in a class ive never had yet! 
    e: danny, sometimes i wonder: if you werent a half ghost, what would you have done with your life?
    e: for me i would have tried out sports. its kinda why i wanted to watch the olympics! 
    d: i guess i would have wanted to be an astronaut. still do.
    d: not sure nasa accepts any ghost applicants though. 
    e: i was just thinking, these athletes are the best in the world. 
        we can train as hard as we can, but we'd never be recognized as an equal. 
    e: we cant compete alongside others in... leagues or the olympics, or... anything?
    e: we'd always be othered. 
    d: we're half ghosts, not a lot of people can say that about themselves. with cool powers and all! 
    e: too ghostly to be human, too human to be ghostly.
    e: you remember that josh fight from a couple months ago? where everyone named josh 
        fought in a pool noodle battle to be the superior josh?
    d: yeah it was hilarious!
    e: it was... but i also remember thinking it was stupid. 
        bc... i used to think i had to fight you to be the superior "danny", 
        i dont think that anymore, but that thought made me sick.
    d: you dont have to be the best "danny" or... anything!
        you dont have to be olympic levels "best in the world"
        you just have to be the best version of /yourself/ that you can be. 
    e: i feel like im still figuring that out. who i am. 
    d: thats okay. im figuring it out too.
    d: and, its okay to take breaks while figuring yourself out. know your limits. jazz helped me figure that one out.
    d: besides, we learned something new about you thats different from me: i never cared much for the olympics.
