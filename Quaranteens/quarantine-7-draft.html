    danny: do i need to remind you that you still need a 2nd dose of that ghost vaccine i gave you?
    danny: a 2nd dose that i never gave you yet?

    vlad: did you think id inject an unknown drug into myself without analyzing it at the molecular level
    danny: so you ripped it apart molecule by molecule got it
    vlad: you cant use the 'ghost vaccine' as a bargainning chip.
    vlad: you lost that advantage when you offered me a single dose and ive already synthesized another
    vlad: i will give you no documentation on the creation of a ghost clone.

             addendum: phantom provided us with a heavily redacted document that detailed elle's synthesis. 
             there are indications of an impure or incomplete dna sample used as a source, 
             unsanitary lab conditions and purity / amount of ectoplans can affect success rate of any detailed steps in the cloning process. 
             whoever documented the cloning process was a very lazy scientist. 
             elle'S physiology is surprisingly resiliant despite this. 
             post it: however elle came to be into our lives, we are glad she is here

        weight - lighter than average, but within benchmarks for her age and height range. 
            lighter weight can be attributed to ectoplasm to body mass ratio. notably a few points off from Danny's ratio but this can
            be attritbuted to environmental factors as well as genetic differences. continue to monitor height and weight and ensure regular food intake.

    tweet: jazz - you have a sister?

<!-- convo between danny and elle (josh fight, etc)
reference josh fight
    //todo script
    elle: wow those athletes are amazing! they must train really hard
    elle: and they dont even have powers!
    danny: hah i bet those guys never slacked off in gym class! 
    elle: i cant slack off in a class ive never had yet! 

    elle: danny, sometimes i wonder: if you werent a half ghost, what would you have done with your life?
    elle: for me i would have tried out sports. its kinda why I wanted to watch the olympics! 
    danny: i guess i would have wanted to be an astronaut. still do.
    danny: not sure nasa accepts any ghost applicants though. 
    elle: i was just thinking, these athletes are the best in the world. 
        we can train as hard as we can, but we'd never be recognized as an equal. 
    elle: we cant compete alongside others in... leagues or the olympics, or... anything?
    elle: we'd always be othered. 
    danny: we're half ghosts, not a lot of people can say that about themselves. with cool powers and all! 
    elle: too ghostly to be human, too human to be ghostly.
    elle: you remember that josh fight from a couple months ago? where everyone named josh 
        fought in a pool noodle battle to be the superior josh?
    danny: yeah it was hilarious!
    elle: it was... but i also remember thinking it was stupid. 
        bc... i used to think i had to fight you to be the superior "danny", 
        i dont think that anymore, but that thought made me sick.
    danny: you dont have to be the best "danny" or... anything!
        you dont have to be olympic levels "best in the world"
        you just have to be the best version of /yourself/ that you can be. 
    elle: i feel like im still figuring that out. who i am. 
    danny: thats okay. im figuring it out too.
    danny: and, its okay to take breaks while figuring yourself out. know your limits. jazz helped me figure that one out.
    danny: besides, we learned something new about you thats different from me: i never cared much for the olympics.

<!--  jazz notes on their training part 2 - improvement (jazz if you see this you owe me $20 --danny -elle)
        -- same stats / notes as earlier w higher numbers
        -- duplication / teleportation training 
        comparing them to anime protagonists undergoing some training arc is very effective.
