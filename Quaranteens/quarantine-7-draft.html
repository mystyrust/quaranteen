    danny: oh so now you care. 

    danny: do i need to remind you that you still need a 2nd dose of that ghost vaccine i gave you?
    danny: a 2nd dose that i never gave you yet?

    vlad: did you think id inject an unknown drug into myself without analyzing it at the molecular level
    danny: so you ripped it apart molecule by molecule got it
    vlad: you cant use the 'ghost vaccine' as a bargainning chip.
    vlad: you lost that advantage when you offered me a single dose and ive already synthesized another
    vlad: i will give you no documentation on the creation of a ghost clone.

        analysis: ---
        notes: genetic similarities between each parent and sibling (donut chart)
             addendum: phantom provided us with a heavily redacted document that detailed elle's synthesis. 
             there are indications of an impure or incomplete dna sample used as a source, 
             unsanitary lab conditions and purity / amount of ectoplans can affect success rate of any detailed steps in the cloning process. 
             whoever documented the cloning process was a very lazy scientist. 
             elle'S physiology is surprisingly resiliant despite this. 
             post it: however elle came to be into our lives, we are glad she is here

        assumed 12 years of age. 
        weight - lighter than average, but within benchmarks for her age and height range. 
            lighter weight can be attributed to ectoplasm to body mass ratio. notably a few points off from Danny's ratio but this can
            be attritbuted to environmental factors as well as genetic differences. continue to monitor height and weight and ensure regular food intake.

<!-- convo between danny and elle (josh fight, etc)
reference josh fight, phantom planet

    elle: wow those athletes are amazing! they must train really hard
    danny: and they dont even have powers!

    danny: ...like... imagine if a giant asteroid hurtled towards earth or something
    danny: since you and i can fly, and we're pretty strong, we're basically the first line of defense for the planet
    elle: really? us, and not nasa, or the international space station?
    danny: okay, you're right, ghosts fighting against an asteroid is pretty dumb.
    
    danny: its just, if i werent a ghost, i guess i would have wanted to be an astronaut
    danny: not sure nasa accepts any ghost applicants - but we can technically fly into space! 

    elle: if i werent a half ghost, i guess i would have tried out sports. its kinda why I wanted to watch the olympics! 
    danny: oh wow! i don't think Jazz or I kept up with  olympics or sports in any way.

    elle: you remember that josh fight from a couple months ago? where everyone named josh 
        fought in a pool noodle battle to be the superior josh?
    danny: yeah it was hilarious!
    elle: it was... 
    
    elle: but i also remember thinking it was stupid. 
    elle: bc... i used to think i had to fight you to be the superior "danny", 
    elle: i dont think that anymore, but i hate that i ever did.
    danny: you dont have to be the best "danny" or... anything!
    danny: you dont have to be olympic levels "best in the world"
    danny: you just have to be the best version of /yourself/ that you can be. 
    elle: i feel like im still figuring that out. who i am. 
    danny: thats okay. im figuring it out too.
    danny: and, its okay to take breaks while figuring yourself out. know your limits. jazz helped me figure that one out.

    elle: yeah, im my own person and not the person i was cloned from, 
    elle: but im glad you guys are beside me while i figure it all out.

<!--  jazz notes on their training part 2 - improvement (jazz if you see this you owe me $20 --danny -elle)
        -- same stats / notes as earlier w higher numbers
        -- duplication / teleportation training 
        comparing them to anime protagonists undergoing some training arc is very effective.
    
    at some point, valerie finds out and punches danny in the eye - make a note about his speed healing 
    jazz makes a note to incorporate sports caster narration for elles trainings -->

<!-- a note about the quarantine lifting and schools in amity park resuming in person schooling 
    Families of Amity Park,

    With the social distance mandate becoming more relaxed and vaccines becoming more available, 
    all schools in Amity Park will start the upcoming school year with a hybrid learning model, alaternating between in person and online attendance. 
    Students must show proof of vaccination and wear face masks at all times, until further notice from the CDC. 

    Measures will be taken to maintain social distnace parameters even when students are attending in person classes. 
    Lunch will not be cooked in the cafeteria without a prior headcount, so please fill out the appropriate documentation if students intend to get food from the school.
   
    It has been a long quarantine, and we hope everyone has done their best to for their own health and for others.
    
    We look forward to seeing our students in person again.  

    - Principal Ishiyama
