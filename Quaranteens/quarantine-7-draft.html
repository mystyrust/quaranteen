<!-- a note about the quarantine lifting and schools in amity park resuming in person schooling 
    Families of Amity Park,

    With the social distance mandate becoming more relaxed and vaccines becoming more available, 
    all schools in Amity Park will start the upcoming school year with a hybrid learning model, alaternating between in person and online attendance. 
    Students must show proof of vaccination and wear face masks at all times, until further notice from the CDC. 

    Measures will be taken to maintain social distnace parameters even when students are attending in person classes. 
    Lunch will not be cooked in the cafeteria without a prior headcount, so please fill out the appropriate documentation if students intend to get food from the school.
   
    It has been a long quarantine, and we hope everyone has done their best to for their own health and for others.
    
    We look forward to seeing our students in person again.  

    - Principal Ishiyama
