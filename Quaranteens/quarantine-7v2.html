        <span><u>DNA analysis of Elle Fenton</u> - performed by Jack and Madeline Fenton</span><br><br>
        <span>
            Danny provided us with a partially redacted document written by the person responsible for creating Elle. 
            We don't know who (a human? a ghost?) created Elle or why, but we have some idea how. 
            <br><br>
            Any scientist worth their salt would know that using anything less than Pluripotent Stem Cells would not differentiate into a fully formed organism.
            Of course, this scientist must have broken a lot of ethical (and legal) laws to acquire 
            any amount of Pluripotent Stem cells so they must already have a few screws loose. 
            They're also incredibly unorganized in their note taking process. 
            <br><br>
            Similar to the described methods, we amplified and sequenced Elle's DNA using PCR. 
            We did the same for Danny and Jazz's DNA as well, for a baseline to compare against.

        On average, full siblings possess 50% of their genes with each other. Of course, more than and less than 50% genetic similarity is possible
        (in the case of identical twins, 100% of their genes are similar). While Elle's DNA is an incomplete copy of Danny's genes, 
        she has more genetic similarity to Jazz than Danny does. This indicates that the DNA sample she originated from was most likely impure 
        - we share combs in this house and the hair could have easily been from 2 or more people. 
        <br><br>
        It is also possible that the self healing nature of Ectoplasm healed her at the molecular level, 
        filling in her missing base sequences before she was even born and allowing her to be a biological stable person. 
        There is a lot we do not know about ectophysiology and how Elle's own physiology affects her growth and development, 
        but we will continue to monitor and document for future reference.

            <span><span class="underline">flight mobility</span>: fly inbetween trees without phasing through them, 
                <br> avoid moving / projectile objects (dads bad aim put to good use)
                <br> danny: got hit with paint 4 times. 2 tree slams.
                <br> elle: 3 hits with paint. no tree slams.

            <span><span class="underline">aim</span>: firing ecto blasts at stationary and moving objects 
                <br> danny: 68% accuracy stationary, 45% accuracy moving
                <br> elle: 79% accuracy stationary, 48% accuracy moving

                <br> not training related, but danny and elle went out for a walk yesterday and met valerie. 
                    danny had a black eye when he came back. 
                <br> i was gonna give him meds and a cold compress but told me he didnt need them.
                    black eye healed 2 hours later

<!-- a note about the quarantine lifting and schools in amity park resuming in person schooling -->
<br><br>
<span class="letter-doc">
    <span>
    Families of Amity Park,
    <br><br>
    With the social distance mandate becoming more relaxed and vaccines becoming more available, 
    all schools in Amity Park will start the upcoming school year with a hybrid learning model, alaternating between in person and online attendance. 
    Students must show proof of vaccination and wear face masks at all times, until further notice from the CDC. 
    <br><br>
    Measures will be taken to maintain social distnace parameters even when students are attending in person classes. 
    Lunch will not be cooked in the cafeteria without a prior headcount, so please fill out the appropriate documentation if students intend to get food from the school.
    <br><br>
    It has been a long quarantine, and we hope everyone has done their best to for their own health and for others.
    <br><br>
    We look forward to seeing our students in person again.  
    <br><br>
    - Principal Ishiyama

    <span class="breply"> do i need to remind you that you still need a 2nd dose of that ghost vaccine i gave you?</span>
    <span class="breply"> a 2nd dose that i never gave you yet?</span>

    <span class="text"> did you think id inject an unknown drug into myself without analyzing it at the molecular level</span>
    <span class="breply"> so you ripped it apart molecule by molecule got it</span>
    <span class="text"> you cant use the 'ghost vaccine' as a bargainning chip.</span>
    <span class="text"> you lost that advantage when you offered me a single dose and ive already synthesized another</span>
