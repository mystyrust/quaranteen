# About
* Just the raw html and css for [tired quaranteens](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27314074/chapters/66735937), a social media themed Danny Phantom fanfic hosted. I had an imagination and I decided to make that everyone's problem. 
* AO3 friendly css. 
* Base Fic is in Quaranteens folder. OtherHtml folder has some sprinkles of coding for other fics. If you've noticed reused twitter usernames, it's because I reused my twitter template (a twitter cinematic universe lmao). 
* Other folder and Tabs folder have some css experiments I was messing around with. tabs3-3 is the most successful exp so far.
* Docs Exp has some hilarious failed attempts (and semi successful??) experiments that I plan to use in Ch 7

# Tools 
Let's see I used
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - free to download, light weight text editor from that lets you wirte and organize code 
* imgur for static image hosting
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) / [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (and ofcourse, google) to reference CSS documentation. 
* [icons8](https://icons8.com/) for icons 
* google image search for background shots from the show


###### listen ao3 doesnt allow a ton of css and i have feelings about flex boxes now.
