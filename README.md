# About
Just the raw html and css for [tired quaranteens](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27314074/chapters/66735937), a social media themed Danny Phantom fanfic. I had an imagination and I decided to make that everyone's problem. 

# Tools 
Let's see I used
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - free to download, light weight text editor from that lets you wirte and organize code 
* imgur for static image hosting
* MDN / W3Schools (and ofcourse, google) to reference CSS documentation. 
* [icons8](https://icons8.com/) for icons 
* google image search for background shots from the show
