<!-- begin notes (ch 1) -->
<!-- the gotham gossip -->
be sure to leave creators style on! should be dark mode / reversi compatible as well.
timeline is loosely within ladybug season 4 -- alya knows, and marinette is guardian of the miracle box.
(there is one section thats kinda wide on mobile, but scrollable. should be fine on tablet / desktop)

<!-- end notes ch 1 -->
what could possibly go wrong? 

<!-- begin notes ch 2 -->
<!-- the paris problem -->
most email / text timestamps in this ch should be marinettes timezone -- where applicable 

<!-- end notes -->

lmao i wondered how / why nobody noticed that marinette never got akumatized but everyone else in her class did, and then thats how this fic idea was born (that and i wanted to try out some new formats...)
<br> (the security details on the email are clickable -- not <em>needed</em> for understanding the story i just thought it was neat)
<br ><br >
also, i approximated gotham city to be generically in the american midwest, which would put it 7 hours behind paris. 
well, i tried to guestimate that whereever there were timestamps,... they should all technically line up...
