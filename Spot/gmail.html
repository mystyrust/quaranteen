       Hello,
       <br><br>
       I'm a member of 
       a network of heroes in The United States 
       and the superhero activity of the city of Paris has only recently come to my attention. 
       Despite the social media activity activity, the akumatization phenomenon 
       is limited to Paris, and not very well known or understood to those of us outside.
       <br><br>
       Why? And what can we do to support? 
       <br><br>
       Signed,<br>
       Red Robin

    Hi Red Robin, <br>
    I'm Alya from the Ladyblog.
    <br><br>
    We've had foreign superheroes visit us to help with the akuma problem in the past -- including Wonder Woman and Green Lantern! --
    but after a couple of them got akumatized, Paris has stopped asking foreign superheroes for aid.
    <br><br>
    Luckily, we are self sufficient with the comeptency of Ladybug and 
    various other Miraculous holders who aid from time to time. 
    Strangely enough, while the akuma problem has deterred foreign aid, it's increased tourism to the city
    -- perhaps the thrill of witnessing an akuma attack is more alluring than expected
    thanks to social media and Ladybug's success rate. 
    <br><br>
    Just because Paris can handle akuma attacks doesn't mean it isn't a problem 
    -- our city could really do with developing ways to gain immunity to akumatization, or figuring out who or where Hawkmoth is. 
    At any rate, if you plan to visit Paris, I advise you do so as a civilian on vacation, 
    instead of as an official hero! You can follow the guides I posted to the Ladyblog, such as
    <span class="fake_a">Reducing Risk of Akumatization while visiting Paris</span> and 
    <span class="fake_a">What to do in the event of akuma attack.</span>
    I can't promise you'll meet Ladybug though. 
    <br><br>
    Thanks for contacting us and showing an interest in our city! 
    If you ever have any questions, just feel free to ask!
    <br><br>
    Alya C <br>
    Founder of the Ladyblog.

Hi, I dont know who you are but I think you've made a mistake. 
I am not who you think I am, despite what your evidence may suggest.

You do not have a complete picture of what goes on in Paris. 
Here's a video my friend and I were taking while an akuma attack was taking place in Paris 2 days ago, 
I was on camera the entire time before, during, and after the akuma attack, filming a video for history class.
(The video was too large to attach to this email, so <span class="fake_a">here's a link</span> to it on youtube, it's unlisted)

I hope we can come to an understanding,
Marinette

Nice try "Hawkmoth"
You can't fool me with doctored footage. And even if it wasn't, 
how convenient is it that the only footage that can serve as an alibi to you exists 
/after/ my accusations? It's almost as if you planned for that akuma attack.

My ultimatum won't change. Time is ticking, Marinette.
