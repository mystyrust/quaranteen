      <p><strong>Akumatization</strong> refers to the process by which an <span class="fake_a">akuma</span> transforms a civilian into a superpowered being – complete with costumed accessories and an alias. 
        Akumatized people are typically considered ‘villains’ who are brainwashed into the service of <span class="fake_a">Hawkmoth</span><sup><span class="fake_a">[1]</span></sup>. 
        The only way to free a person from akumatization is to break the object where the akuma entered<sup><span class="fake_a">[2]</span></sup>, and for the akuma to be purified by <span class="fake_a">Ladybug</span><sup><span class="fake_a">[3]</span></sup>. 
        A person can be akumatized for as short as a few minutes, or as long as several days <sup>(<span class="fake_a">citation needed</span>)</sup>.
         Akumatized people have reported missing memories during their time brainwashed – due to this, and the fact that property damage is typically undone with the help of Ladybug, 
         any crimes committed by an akumatized person is not punishable by law<span class="fake_a">[4]</span></sup>. 
         Many formerly akumatized people remember having psychic conversations with Hawkmoth. </p>

         <p> History</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        While akumas have only become more well known to the public thanks to social media, 
        it is speculated that people have been akumatized many a times in the past. 
        It is known that akumas are created thanks to the power of the <span class="fake_a">Butterfly miraculous</span>. 
        Ladybug, the holder of the <span class="fake_a">Ladybug miraculous</span>, and 
        <span class="fake_a">Cat Noir</span>, the holder of the <span class="fake_a">Cat miraculous</span>, 
        are frequent targets of akumatized person’s. It is believed this is because Hawkmoth desires their miraculous. 
        In the modern day, akumatization has been geographically limited to <span class="fake_a">Paris</span>. 
        Archeologists speculate that the Ladybug and Cat miraculouses have been used by notable revolutionaries through out history <sup>(<span class="fake_a">citation needed</span>)</sup>.

            <p>Last halloween was probably the scariest in Paris -- instead of dressing up as goblins or werewolves or other monsters, 
                people dressed up as akumatized villains! It sure made some costume contests extremely difficult to judge,
                 especially when some contests went into character. <br><br> Many people speculate that an akuma's costume isn't designed by them, but by Hawkmoth, via a psychic connection.
                 Hawkmoth must be a terrible fashion designer if all akuma costumes are so garish looking and unpractical, but they give costumers a fun time.
                 Here's the top 10 scariest and most accurate akuma costumes from last Halloween.
