            <span>Mistaken for a shoe salesman and the a pizza delivery guy in the past, 
                this ghost calls himself 'the box ghost'. he might change his nickname to claim other niches, but overall he is weak and not worth running away from (or, running away towards, if you're a ghost hunter in Amity Park). If you ever see him, you can go about your day without any interruptions. </span>

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
