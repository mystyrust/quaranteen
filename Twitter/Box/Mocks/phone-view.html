            <span>Mistaken for a shoe salesman and the a pizza delivery guy in the past, 
                this ghost calls himself 'the box ghost'. he might change his nickname to claim other niches, but overall he is weak and not worth running away from (or, running away towards, if you're a ghost hunter in Amity Park). If you ever see him, you can go about your day without any interruptions. </span>

        Let’s get it out of the way: not all ghosts are bad ghosts, some just wanna finish their degree or something. But ever since Phantom was spotted working at Hot Topic, the question of ghost employment has been the hottest topic (pun intended) on people’s minds. 
        <br><br>Ghosts can provide labor that neither machines nor humans can, but also have no need for food, water, or sleep – how might this affect their potential pay rate? The Fentons say that any ghosts employed should be paid the same rate as human employees, given that many ghosts were former humans and not all ghosts have the same abilities. In a rare show of partnership, labor union leaders are collaborating with VladCo lawyers to draft laws to increase the pay of ghost employees, so that ghosts are not exploited for labor and do not displace the human employees. This collaboration was made easier after the dissolution of the Guys In White.
        <br><br>Do ghosts need to eat like humans? Phantom has been seen eating Nasty Burgers and drinking coffee, so perhaps they eat for (a questionable taste of) pleasure.
        <br><br>We can’t guarantee who does or doesn’t return to amity park as a ghost, but we can make the experience more bearable for those who do. Let’s let ghosts integrate into our economy and society.
