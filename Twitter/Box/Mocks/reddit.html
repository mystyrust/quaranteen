    <p class="rd-header">AITA for allowing some students to submit late homework, but not others? </p>
    <p> 
        <br>Throw away in case my students find this.
        <br><br>I teach high school english literature. I am not a strict teacher. my late policy is outlined in the syllabus – up to 2 assignments per semester can be turned in late no questions asked, otherwise, the student must provide documentation ahead of time explaining why they would not be able to turn in assignments on time before I grant them any extensions. Extracurriculars are considered valid excuses. Every student is made aware of at the beginning of the semester. 
        <br><br>Despite this, if I see a normally hard working student fall behind, I can make exceptions for them, and allow them to submit homework late.
        <br><br>However, I have a student - lets call him B - who is chronically absent from class. B does not engage with class discussion and takes frequent “bathroom breaks” to escape exams and such. I have allowed him to submit late homework more often than the syllabus allows, and I fear he is taking advantage of my leniency. 
        <br><br>(For context, I have become lenient with my late policy in recent months because local vigilante activities have interrupted class time and disproportionately inflicted property damage.)
        <br><br>Now I want to push B to better participate in class, so I thought it was time he faced some consequences for his tardiness. Thirty minutes after inputting his (deserved) zeroes into our grading system, he came into my office pleading for an extension. I declined, because the assignment was already three weeks overdue. 
        <br><br>B pointed out that I let members of the football team turn in the same assignment earlier today – the reason I made this exception was because they gave me a letter ahead of time, with a signature from their coach about their practice schedule and away games, and had requested accommodations ahead of time. 
        <br><br>B had done no such thing, so I did not grant him any accommodation. B complained that the local vigilante activity interfered with his sleep schedule, but I pointed out that it was a poor excuse because it didn't interfere with anyone elses sleep schedule.
        <br><br>I was hoping that seeing the zeroes in his gradebook will motivate him to do better in his next assignments, but instead he sulked out of the classroom in disappointment. 
        <br><br>So: AITA for treating this student differently?
    </p> <br />

        I mean back in my day we would ditch school after staying up late for movie premieres, and now they stream half of those online. Modern problems modern solutions or whatever.

    without going into too much detail i live in a small town in Illinois that has ghost attacks. I am not here to debate if ghosts are real or not, that is besides the point.

        NTA because a chronic level of tardiness will have consequences in the real world and the work force, so its good that you teach him about that now while hes still young

     INFO – did A have some type of family emergency that he couldn’t document in writing ahead of time? I hate to assume, but is B in a bad crowd? Does he do substance?
     <br/>

     No. B participates in extra curriculars in school to varying degree.

     if he has time to do that, he can either do his homework on time or get documentation for why he cant.
