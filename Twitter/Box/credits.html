<!-- begin notes -->
<p>while this one shot can be read alone, its kind of a spiritual successor / sequel / finale to the other fics in this series 
    and im tentatively marking this series as complete,..for now.. </p>
<p>because of all the custom html / css, this fic cant be downloaded for offline reading (oops) </p>
<br /><br /><br />
