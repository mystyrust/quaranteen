        Dear Students,<br /><br />
        If you get this email, you have missing assignments for my English Literature Class.
        If I continue to remain lenient with the late homework and quizzes policy, I fear some of you will have to repeat this course. As a reminder, I have attached a copy of the syllabus to this email, which contains my late homework policy. I hope to see you all pass my class. <br ><br >

    <p class="rd-header">AITA for allowing some students to submit late homework, but not others? </p>
    <p> 
        <br>Throw away in case my students find this.
        <br><br>I teach high school english literature. I am not a strict teacher. my late policy is outlined in the syllabus – up to 2 assignments per semester can be turned in late no questions asked, otherwise, the student must provide documentation ahead of time explaining why they would not be able to turn in assignments on time before I grant them any extensions. Extracurriculars are considered valid excuses. Every student is made aware of at the beginning of the semester. 
        <br><br>Despite this, if I see a normally hard working student fall behind, I can make exceptions for them, and allow them to submit homework late.
        <br><br>However, I have a student - lets call him B - who is chronically absent from class. B does not engage with class discussion and takes frequent “bathroom breaks” to escape exams and such. I have allowed him to submit late homework more often than the syllabus allows, and I fear he is taking advantage of my leniency. 
        <br><br>(For context, I have become lenient with my late policy in recent months because local vigilante activities have interrupted class time and disproportionately inflicted property damage.)
        <br><br>Now I want to push B to better participate in class, so I thought it was time he faced some consequences for his tardiness. Thirty minutes after inputting his (deserved) zeroes into our grading system, he came into my office pleading for an extension. I declined, because the assignment was already three weeks overdue. 
        <br><br>B pointed out that I let members of the football team turn in the same assignment earlier today – the reason I made this exception was because they gave me a letter ahead of time, with a signature from their coach about their practice schedule and away games, and had requested accommodations ahead of time. 
        <br><br>B had done no such thing, so I did not grant him any accommodation. B complained that the local vigilante activity interfered with his sleep schedule, but I pointed out that it was a poor excuse because it didn't interfere with anyone elses sleep schedule.
        <br><br>I was hoping that seeing the zeroes in his gradebook will motivate him to do better in his next assignments, but instead he sulked out of the classroom in disappointment. 
        <br><br>So: AITA for treating this student differently?
    </p> <br />

    without going into too much detail i live in a small town in Illinois that has ghost attacks. I am not here to debate if ghosts are real or not, that is besides the point.

        NTA because a chronic level of tardiness will have consequences in the real world and the work force, so its good that you teach him about that now while hes still young

     INFO – did A have some type of family emergency that he couldn’t document in writing ahead of time? I hate to assume, but is B in a bad crowd? Does he do substance?

     if he has time to do that, he can either do his homework on time or get documentation for why he cant.

<!-- news opinion article about ghost employment -->
<div class="letter">
    <p class="paper-name">Amity Park News</p>
    <p class="paper-title">(Some) ghosts are here to stay</p>
    <p class="paper-subtitle">might as well get used to it? (opinion)</p>
    <p class="paper-text fadeout">
        Let’s get it out of the way: not all ghosts are bad ghosts, some just wanna finish their degree or something. But ever since Phantom was spotted working at Hot Topic, the question of ghost employment has been the hottest topic (pun intended) on people’s minds. 
        <br><br>Ghosts can provide labor that neither machines nor humans can, but also have no need for food, water, or sleep – how might this affect their potential pay rate? The Fentons say that any ghosts employed should be paid the same rate as human employees, given that many ghosts were former humans and not all ghosts have the same abilities. In a rare show of partnership, labor union leaders are collaborating with VladCo lawyers to draft laws to increase the pay of ghost employees, so that ghosts are not exploited for labor and do not displace the human employees. This collaboration was made easier after the dissolution of the Guys In White.
        <br><br>Do ghosts need to eat like humans? Phantom has been seen eating Nasty Burgers and drinking coffee, so perhaps they eat for (a questionable taste of) pleasure.
        <br><br>We can’t guarantee who does or doesn’t return to amity park as a ghost, but we can make the experience more bearable for those who do. Let’s let ghosts integrate into our economy and society.
